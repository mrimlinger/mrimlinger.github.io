## Day 1

6h30. Waking up, showering, eating breakfast. Time for last farewells. 7h30. Departure from Cäsar-Ritz Strasse. I ride to Zurich HB. 8h05 Train to Göschenen. The scenery outside is beautiful. 10h24. Departure from Göschenen with the <red train>. The train climbs into a narrow valley, we are really in the mountains now. 10h36. Arrival at Andermatt. Official departure of the tour and the Eurovelo 15. I first go see the Devil's brige (Teufelsbrücke). Very impressive.  Undescriptible state of excitement and euphoria, just like a kid. It's (finally) adventure time once again. 

Then real business starts. First step: reaching the Oberalppass, ~700 meters up in altitude above Andermatt. Why not taking the train up to the pass? That would be too easy. Suffering is part of the journey. I must know what it takes to enjoy the latter descent. Anyway. The climb is hard. Very hard. I go slowly, low gear, making pauses every few kilometers. And slowly I'm rising above the valley, enjoying the sight. Tunnels are scary though, despite having lights on the bike. Drivers are respectful and the road is very good. I'm also getting used to the physic of the loaded bike, which is quite different from usual.

After two hours of endeavours, I finally reach the pass! Great satisfaction. On the way up I met Amhed, a sixty-eight y.o. Morrocan Swiss guy living in Geneva. Once at the pass he offers me a drink and tells me about his life. Then we go separate ways, him returning back, me continuing on the other side. On the other side in question, slightly below the pass is where the Rhine starts (technically in the Toma See).

The way down is crazy. The amount of adrenaline equals the pain of the way up. Lots of fun. 
After about an hour of descent on car road, the EuroVelo switches to dirt paths. Funny too.
18h. I'm getting tired, it is time to find a place for the night. I stop in Trun. I don't want to pay for camping (...) so I start searching for a place to lay camp in nature. I'm feeling very adventurous. I find a spot away from the village. 19h. Bath time. I go take a plunge naked in the Rhine to removeall the sweat from the day. Very refreshing and pleasant for the muscles after a day of riding. I also rince my shirt.

19h30h. (First time) mounting the tent, I'm proud of my work. 21h. I leave for the village in search of a place to have a beer and to charge my phone. I find a bar, perfect. Plus, beer is cheap here in comparison to Zurich. I write all this stuff. Some friendly locals in their twenties/thirties invite me to join them, we discuss in german / swiss german. I also finally discover Romanche, the fourth official language of Switzerland. They seem to have a pleasant life living here close to nature. It's nice to meet new people :)
23h. I return to my tent outside of the village. The way in the dark dark night is a bit scary. I go to bed. It's actually the first time I camp all alone (Hugo where are you?). That too is scary. But it's fine, I'm finally happy to rest. I hope I won't be annoyed by the police during the night for illegal camping.

## Day 2

6h45. Waking up, packing up the camp. Everything is cold and wet from the night, gross. I didn't sleep so well. I eat a bit for breakfast, and then go reach some sun on the other side of the valley. Pleasant. Adventure can continue. Buying some food at the supermarket. 8h45 Departure from Trun.
Nice unpaved road going along the Rhine and in the forest. Sometimes it's just a track, very fun to ride. 10h. Little break(fast n°2). Already ~15km behind me. I like the uncertainty of travelling, not knowing what's next. I feel like living completely in the present. The route is now on the main road and climbs up the side of the valley. Some effort. 12h I reach some sort of pass, from there it's downhill racing. So much fun, plus the scenery is incredible.
13h Sandwich lunch at the junction between Vorderrhein and Hinterrhein. 14h Back on the road towards Chur. The valley broadens and is flat in its centre. The rhine is now also a proper large river, not a big mountain torrent anymore. 15h Break in Chur (capital of canton Graubünden), recharging my phone in a café and buying more food. Appart from the cute old town the city does not seem very interesting. 16h30 Leaving Chur towards the North. The route is a cycling path thatgoes along the Rhine, train tracks and highways. 
Face wind, that's tough.

18h30 Reaching Igis where I intend to spend the night. I don't to pay 15chf for an official camping (bcs you pay for lots of stuff like washing machine, wifi, hot shower, electricity, etc. which I don't need atm). So I start searching for a place where I can put my tent. I decide to go the legal way by asking a private for permission. I ask a farmer if he has such place, then another, without success. I discuss with a local walking his dog around the fields, he recommends me a farm. I check there, meet a couple in their 50s also walking there and buying products from the farm. They introduce me to the woman owning the farm and her daughter, who are very kind and happy to let me camp on their fields. They also let me use the toilets and sink of their farming facilities, that's super nice of them. Their farm is great with very modern, organic livestock and crops farming. We all discuss a bit in german, then I go mount my tent. Take-home message:
- it is always worth it asking and talking to people
- it was really worth it learning german for I can get to know Switzerland and its (very kind) people better

21h The night falls. I feel alive, so alive. Also I've seldom been so hungry in my entire life. 
Dipping cervelas in jam is lit af. {cervela, cheese, jam} sandwich is the new cuisine, and no one is there to judge me. I'm eating so much. I also make use of my gas stove to make some tea, it's nice to have a warm drink. 00h Sleep.

## Day 3

Waken up at 3h30 by the rooster. A thunderstorm is coming in the distance. Sleep again until 8h30. Waking up. I slept well and feel rested (except for half of my blood got sucked off by moskitoes). Also have to remove a tick. Outside is raining but not too much. Weather forecast is not looking good for the day. Journal writting. 

11h30 departure from the farm. Lovely road on the side of the valley, going through vineyards and tiny villages. 13h Shower in the Rhine, very cold but vivifying.I feel wild. 13h30 On the go again. Now cycling on the dike along the Rhine towards the North. Soon Liechtenstein is on the other side. 14h15 Incursion into Liechtenstein, the canton of shame. Really not much to see in Vaduz. Buying food at Coop.
16h30 Back on the Swiss side in Buchs. It starts to rain heavily so I draw my rain suit and convince myself I look good in it. The route goes away from tbe Rhine through fields for a while, lovely. Keeps raining, it's fine with the suit. 18h30 back to the dike of the Rhine ! Rain rain rain whipping rain rain rain. On the other side is now Austria.
19h30 I find the perfect camping spot for the situation in a field under a bridge (thus no rain). Setting up the tent, I'm getting good at this. I find a spot where the custom post of the bridge on the swiss side cannot see me. Dinner, tonight I treat myself with with instant noodles on top of the usual sandwiches. Instant noodles never tasted so great. So nice to have something hot to eat, especially with the wind and rain that keeps pouring. It's getting cold, I shelter in the tent. Outside the noise from the howling wind, the Rhine on the pillars of the bridge and sometimes a car passing on the bridge. The atmosphere is a bit spooky / weird tbh (floodable zone, don't know what kind of people might come since near a small town and highway).
23h00 Sleep

## Day 4

6h45 Waking up. Unmounting the tent. Breakfast. Discussion with some friendly local passing by.
8h30 Departure. It's cold but at least it doesn't rain. Soon the Sun pierces through the clouds and starts warming me up. Pleasant. Riding on the dike. The landscape flattens as I approach the Rhine delta and Bodensee.
9h15 Crossing the Austrian border.
10h Reaching Bodensee. Break on a small beach. Making stuff dry in the Sun.
10h30 Back on the road, crossing fields.
11h Buying food at a supermarket. Crossing the border back into Switzerland. Riding the southern shore of the Bodensee.
Overall it is not very nice, the place has too many people on vacation and construction.
There are also lots of other cyclists which I assume only ride around the lake by sunny days. Lots of e-bikes too.
13h30 romanshorn
15h to 16h sleeping on a bench, I'm a bit tired (but especially hungry it seems bcs I only snacked on the way instead of having a real lunch)
16h30 Reaching Konstanz. Break in a McDonald's to eat something and recharge my phone. Reading a book to make time pass.
Some stress that my bike will get stolen in the street.
18h30 Visiting Konstanz a bit, taking pictures. The old town is really lovely, as well as the lake front.
19h30 Leaving Konstanz. Searching for a place to sleep and clean myself (I feel dirty).
20h I find a bathing spot with public showers on the side of the Rhine. Intuition +++. Peaceful atmosphere as the Sun sets over the water. I snack a sausage while taking pictures - a dog comes and eat it from my bag which I left on the ground. I'm puzzled and amused.
I first bath into the Rhine. I slip when entering the water and hurt my feet a bit. Then a nice (although cold) shower, where I can actually use shower gel (wasn't possible previously when bathing in rivers). Shampooing myself in front of people watching the sunset, a bit weird but idc. Feels good the be clean.
21h15 Night has fallen, back on the road to find a place to camp. Going through fields in the dark night, somewhat spooky.
21h45 I find a camping spot somewhat ok. I hope I won't get fined for sleeping here. Laying camp. 22h Eating. My amazement and pleasure from using the gas burner to make something hot will never tire. Getting eaten alive by moskitoes. F#$@.
00h Sleep

## Day 5

8h Waking up. Writing. Local wildlife service asks me kindly to remove the tent. Packing my stuff. 9h15 Leaving. 9h45 Beautiful little village (Ermattingen). Buying and eating breakfast on the side of the Untersee. 10h30 Continuing along the untersee, cycling paths all the way. Cold wind (fortunately in the back eheh) and grey clouds. 
12h00 Stein am Rhein omggg so beautiful.
12h45 Out of SAR. Going through fields and forests on unpaved road. Multiple border crossings between CH and DE. 13h30 Passing by Diessenhofen, beautiful wooden bridge and village on the side of water. 14h15 Arrival in Schaffhausen. Lunch break. 15h30 Continued break in McDonald's to charge my devices. Reading Kim. 17h30 Buying food for tonight. 18h Leaving Schaffhausen. Passing by the Rhine falls. South side sucks, the view is not great and you have to pay for it. (North is better and free, I know by experience). 18h30 Continuing southwards, lots of driving on the main road, fortunately not many cars. Also some unpaved road in the forest. I am a bit late on schedule if I want to reach Basel tomorrow (I'm invited at the restaurant by my mother ^^), so I hurry up. Going through the hilly countryside, quite some climbing and downhill. Beautiful little villages, beautiful sunset on the fields. 20h Back on the side of the Rhine. 21h I'm exhausted, it's getting dark. Eating dinner, mounting the tent, etc. 22h30 Sleep. Tomorrow I must go early.

## Day 6

6h45 Waking up, packing quickly, eating a bit
7h45 Go. Ugly landscape scarred by open excavation. Lots of industry, not beautiful. Weather is grey, cloudy and fresh. 10h15 Nuclear power plant. 10h45 Break, I'm running out of energy, I have to eat. Lots of hydraulic power plants on the Rhine.
11h45 Go again, lots of driving on the road, a bit uncomfortable when there are lots of truck. Not sot much interesting. Weatger is warming up though, the Sun piercing the clouds.
13h Into the forest close to the river, on an unending unpaved road. Boooooooring, feels obliterating under the Sun.
14h Quick lunch break (sandwich) just before Rheinfallen.
14h30 Back on the road, towards Basel city centre through the extended urban area on the southern side of the river. Nothing interesting really.
16h Meeting my father at the junction between the Birs and the Rhine. He came there by bike to ride a bit with me. I'm so happy to see him! We bath in the fresh river, the Sun makes it perfect.
17h30 We go through Basel on the Southern side of the Rhine and cross the CH-FR border. Then we continue towards home along the Huningue canal and later the Hardt forest.
19h We arrive home! In total I drove 120km today, way more than my usual ~80km. A well deserved hot shower. 
19h30 Dinner at restaurant St-Laurent with my mother, step-father and brother. So nice to taste some fine food after eating only sandwiches for a few days.
