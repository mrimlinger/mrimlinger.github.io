## Day 8

9h00 Planned departure
11h30 Actual departure. Will do better next time. Riding South from my village in direction Basel to cross the border with Germany. I decided to go on the German side of the Rhine since I already know the French side quite well. Furthermore I expect German drivers to be more respectful of bikes on thd road
12h30 Passing the Kembs hydraulic powerplant where my father works. Sandwich break.
13h Crossing FR-DE border at the Kembs dam. Now going back towards the North on the German side. Smooth unpaved road on the side of the natural Rhine (next to it on the French side is the artificial Rhine used for navigation and energy generation).
Nice sightseeing infrastructures.
15h Now going through fields and villages, plus some industrial zones. It feels a bit... sad. Maybe I'm just tired and not in a good mood. Strong face wind, it is really unpleasant. Dreadful. J'en ai plein le $#@.
16h45 Back on the Rhine shore. Nap time, I'm tired.
17h30 Waking up. Eating a sandwich.
18h Going again. The wind has fallen, speed goes from 16km/h to 26km/h ahah. Nice smooth unpaved road on shore. I have stomach but they go away at some point. I meet some young germans going the other way, trying to reach Marseille from Berlin. 
19h15 Reaching Breisach, quickly visiting the city centre.
20h Eating a nice traditional German kebap. I was looking forward to that. Twice better as in Zurich, and twice as cheap. Getting my phone charged.
21h Leaving the Kebap. Searching for a place to mount the tent. A bit difficult in the dark. The night is also quite cold, I'm breathing out steam. Setting up the tent. I can hear music and people partying in the distance.
22h30 Writting. 23h Sleep

## Day 9

8h00 Waking up, packing. Greeting some early walkers.
9h00 Go back to Breisach. OBJ: food for breakfast. It starts raining. It's market day in the city center, I get some fresh bread and pastries ^^. Talking with some locals. I also pass by Lidl to buy some water - too bad that fountains' water is not drinkable in germany.
10h30 Departure from Breisach.
11h It stops raining. Riding on the dike next to the Rhine, on an unpaved gravel road. It's pretty boring.
12h30 The route leaves the dike for some villages. At some point the path is so poorly indicated, the route is zig-zaging in a village, it's complete nonsense. There are plenty of signs all indicating the same names in different directions, all contradicting each other. Fucking nonsense. I'm lost. Plus the village is not even beautiful or interesting. 
Worst day so far, everything sucks. 
13h I find an approximate way towards other villages.
13h15 It starts raining again, what a shitty day. It stops after a bit though - it's annoying having to put the rain pants on and off (otherwise I sweat too much in it).
13h30 Lunch break in a bakery.
14h Back at it, I come near Europa Park in Rust.
14h15 I struggle to get back to EuroVelo15, signs lead to nowhere or stop altogether after a while. It's really annoying, I'm tired and lacking energy, I'm fed up.
14h45 I get back (through car roads) to what is supposedly EV15 on the dike (there are barely signs). I ride there for a while.
16h Switching to FR side in Ottenheim, I can't stand the DE side anymore. Riding on the island between artificial and natural Rhine. Some rain.
16h20 Reaching the "mainland" through Gerstheim hydraulic power plant.
16h45 In Krafft (Erstein) I join the French EV15 that goes along the "Canal du Rhone au Rhin". 15km until Strasbourg, finally! My mood goes up despite the rain, I'm also feeling more energetic. The cycle path is paved and smooth, 
very nice and buccolic with peniches on the canal. Plus the EV15 is very well indicated! But it rains a hell lot.
18h30 Meeting the son of my step-father in Strasbourg. I have an ice-cream at Le Glacier Franchi, very nice (but I'm sooo hungry). We talk for a bit, it's cool. Also meet his sister.
19h45 Going out of Strasbourg. It is really a nice city. I find a free drinking water fountain, jackpot.
20h15 Stopping at a McDonalds. The neighbourhood seems rather popular. I can't say I'm feeling unsafe, but definitely not safe and at ease either. I watch over my bike while in the restaurant. Dinner bien sale, I'm starving.
21h45 Leaving McDonalds. I have to ride more to exit Strasbourg and find a camping place. Riding through the night. In front of the Robertsau forest I meet a young guy doing I don't know what (drugs?) with his friends in the woods, and asking me for a tissue. We talk for a bit, he tells me he's living in the forest (?). Weird. Very friendly though. I continue and enter the forest. It's completely dark. Now that is scary. I man the fuck up and go forward. Trying not to think about horror movies and the likes. It goes on for a long long time (~8km). At some point it's just a super straight cycling path with dense, mid-man size plants directly the sides - kind of swallowing the path - and with tall trees next to them, framing the horizon. Special atmosphere.
So monotonous that I wonder if it's not some kind of trap where I cycle in an infinite loop until exhaustion before being preyed upon by some monster. Focus Matthieu. I exit the forest into the fields and find a place to camp.
23h30 Mounting the tent, going to bed. What a day.
