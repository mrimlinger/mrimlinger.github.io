## Day 8

9h00 Planned departure
11h30 Actual departure. Will do better next time. Riding South from my village in direction Basel to cross the border with Germany. I decided to go on the German side of the Rhine since I already know the French side quite well. Furthermore I expect German drivers to be more respectful of bikes on thd road
12h30 Passing the Kembs hydraulic powerplant where my father works. Sandwich break.
13h Crossing FR-DE border at the Kembs dam. Now going back towards the North on the German side. Smooth unpaved road on the side of the natural Rhine (next to it on the French side is the artificial Rhine used for navigation and energy generation).
Nice sightseeing infrastructures.
15h Now going through fields and villages, plus some industrial zones. It feels a bit... sad. Maybe I'm just tired and not in a good mood. Strong face wind, it is really unpleasant. Dreadful. J'en ai plein le $#@.
16h45 Back on the Rhine shore. Nap time, I'm tired.
17h30 Waking up. Eating a sandwich.
18h Going again. The wind has fallen, speed goes from 16km/h to 26km/h ahah. Nice smooth unpaved road on shore. I have stomach but they go away at some point. I meet some young germans going the other way, trying to reach Marseille from Berlin. 
19h15 Reaching Breisach, quickly visiting the city centre.
20h Eating a nice traditional German kebap. I was looking forward to that. Twice better as in Zurich, and twice as cheap. Getting my phone charged.
21h Leaving the Kebap. Searching for a place to mount the tent. A bit difficult in the dark. The night is also quite cold, I'm breathing out steam. Setting up the tent. I can hear music and people partying in the distance.
22h30 Writting. 23h Sleep

## Day 9

8h00 Waking up, packing. Greeting some early walkers.
9h00 Go back to Breisach. OBJ: food for breakfast. It starts raining. It's market day in the city center, I get some fresh bread and pastries ^^. Talking with some locals. I also pass by Lidl to buy some water - too bad that fountains' water is not drinkable in germany.
10h30 Departure from Breisach.
11h It stops raining. Riding on the dike next to the Rhine, on an unpaved gravel road. It's pretty boring.
12h30 The route leaves the dike for some villages. At some point the path is so poorly indicated, the route is zig-zaging in a village, it's complete nonsense. There are plenty of signs all indicating the same names in different directions, all contradicting each other. Fucking nonsense. I'm lost. Plus the village is not even beautiful or interesting. 
Worst day so far, everything sucks. 
13h I find an approximate way towards other villages.
13h15 It starts raining again, what a shitty day. It stops after a bit though - it's annoying having to put the rain pants on and off (otherwise I sweat too much in it).
13h30 Lunch break in a bakery.
14h Back at it, I come near Europa Park in Rust.
14h15 I struggle to get back to EuroVelo15, signs lead to nowhere or stop altogether after a while. It's really annoying, I'm tired and lacking energy, I'm fed up.
14h45 I get back (through car roads) to what is supposedly EV15 on the dike (there are barely signs). I ride there for a while.
16h Switching to FR side in Ottenheim, I can't stand the DE side anymore. Riding on the island between artificial and natural Rhine. Some rain.
16h20 Reaching the "mainland" through Gerstheim hydraulic power plant.
16h45 In Krafft (Erstein) I join the French EV15 that goes along the "Canal du Rhone au Rhin". 15km until Strasbourg, finally! My mood goes up despite the rain, I'm also feeling more energetic. The cycle path is paved and smooth, 
very nice and buccolic with peniches on the canal. Plus the EV15 is very well indicated! But it rains a hell lot.
18h30 Meeting the son of my step-father in Strasbourg. I have an ice-cream at Le Glacier Franchi, very nice (but I'm sooo hungry). We talk for a bit, it's cool. Also meet his sister.
19h45 Going out of Strasbourg. It is really a nice city. I find a free drinking water fountain, jackpot.
20h15 Stopping at a McDonalds. The neighbourhood seems rather popular. I can't say I'm feeling unsafe, but definitely not safe and at ease either. I watch over my bike while in the restaurant. Dinner bien sale, I'm starving.
21h45 Leaving McDonalds. I have to ride more to exit Strasbourg and find a camping place. Riding through the night. In front of the Robertsau forest I meet a young guy doing I don't know what (drugs?) with his friends in the woods, and asking me for a tissue. We talk for a bit, he tells me he's living in the forest (?). Weird. Very friendly though. I continue and enter the forest. It's completely dark. Now that is scary. Also the mist stemming from the ground does not help. I man the fuck up and go forward. Trying not to think about horror movies and the likes. It goes on for a long long time (~8km). At some point it's just a super straight cycling path with dense, mid-man size plants directly the sides - kind of swallowing the path - and with tall trees next to them, framing the horizon. Special atmosphere.
So monotonous that I wonder if it's not some kind of trap where I cycle in an infinite loop until exhaustion before being preyed upon by some monster. Focus Matthieu. I exit the forest into the fields and find a place to camp.
23h30 Mounting the tent, going to bed. What a day.

## Day 10

8h30 Waking up. Greeted by some slugs around the tent. Calling my grandfather for his birthday. Outside it rains a bit, I'm not very motivated to go out. Breakfast. Writing. At some point I have to go. Packing under the rain is a bit tricky but I manage.
11h15 Departure. The road goes as cycling lane along car road, from small village to small village, some of them with nice traditional houses. Well indicated, pleasant to cycle, it just goes on. Buying some food in a bakery just in time before it closes.
12h45 Passing by Rheinau hydraulic power plant. 
14h Break, I meet two other french guys who already cycled 5000km on their trip. They provide me with some good tips.
14h15 Moving on.
16h 16h25 Another break (I'm hungry), small rain episode. When making sandwiches I realize that my jam started fermenting (hence the spilling of juice out of the jar). No mold fungus, just a slight sparkling taste, it's fine to eat. I get praised by a german guy for what I do (the trip, not the jam), thanks.
17h00 I'm reaching the very North-East tip of France. I now leave EV15 to go to Wissembourg where my uncle and godfather lives. Going there on a cycle lane through fields, it's nice.
18h45 Arrival in wissembourg, very happy to see them. I enjoy a hot shower and a good meal. Some pleasant time with the family.
01h30 Sleep

## Day 11

9h00 Waking up. A good breakfast with the family.
11h15 Departure, my young cousin does not want to see me go, he is so cute. 
riding on cycling path
no rain but cold grey weather, wind on my back
12h30 Back on EV15 next to the Rhine. Small break
12h45 Go. Wind intensifies, fortunately it is sideways.
13h Crossing the FR-DE border (almost unnoticed)
14h15 I reach the bridge leading to Karlsruhe, I go through it and head towards the city center.
14h45 Starts raining quite heavily. 2211
15h00 I find the castle, apparently to only sightworthy thing in this city. Lunch break in front of it (BBQ leftovers 100//). Rain stops for a bit.
16h00 Moving a bit around the castle and the city center. For lack of being beautiful, at least the city center has an interesting layout with main streets as lines leading to the castle, and circular arcs perpendicular to them. Gross public toilets.
17h Leaving the center. Rain resumes, cross city
17h45 Back at the bridge and on EV15
18h Snack break at Lidl. 
18h30 Going. The route goes along dikes built further away from the Rhine, to protect fields from floodings. It alternates between forest and fields, which is good for boredom concerns. With the Sun starting to set down, some mist going off the ground, and the very first colours of Autumn starting to slightly appear, it gives me the impression of some romanticism painting.
20h Back on the very shore of the Rhine.
20h15 Stop at Germersheim in a Biergarten. Some sausages with bread and a beer for dinner. It would have superb except for the insane amount of moskitoes flying around. Since the place is so wet lately (rain, floodings, etc.) they just proliferated and infested the place. I realize the place is full of slavic people, probably because of the Mercedes manufacture nearby.
21h Going to find a place to camp. Finding my way out of some industrial zone at night. In a small village, where the last gaslamp stops casting its light, entering the dark dark night. Literal swarms of moskitoes. Difficult to find a suitable camping place. 
23h15 Back on some dike route, there I can put my tent. The environment is however hostile to me with so much moskitoes wanfing to suck my blood. I hastily mount the tent. Can one die of moskito haemorragia? Joke aside I fear to have an allergic reaction.
23h45 Finally in bed. I try to eradicate any moskito from inside the tent. I fear I am starting to get sick, my nose is really blocked and my throat starts being painful. Bad sleep.

## Day 12

9h45 Waking up. I had a really bad night. The moskitoes would not leave me alone (bites countable in tens), and I'm really getting sick (obstructed nose, painfull throat, feeling cold, muscle aches). Weather is gloomy too (wind, not warm, clouds). It's horrible, I lack the strength to pack my stuff, I'm shivering.
12h Finally I can go. My condition seems to worsen as I ride. I'm going super slow and nearly sleep on the bike.
12h30 Big nap in the grass, I enjoy a bit of Sun. I book a hotel room in the nearest town so that I can rest and heal.
14h15 I try to go again, must reach Speyer 6.5 km from here. Honestly the worst kilometers ever. Plus I now have a strong headache, every bump in the road is a hammer strike in my head.
15h00 Finally reached Speyer. Hot chocolate and cake break.
15h45 I feel slightly better, I go reach the hotel.
16h Checking in, going directly to bed. My whole body is aching, I'm KO.

## Day 13 

Rest day, sick. Sleeping.
Going a bit outside in the afternoon though, getting slightly better.

## Day 14

8h45 Waking up, packing, checking out from the hotel.
9h45 Going accross the city, sneaking on a construction site on a bridge to take a picture of the cathedral.
10h15 Breakfast with hot chocolate in a bakery ^^
10h45 Breakfast is over, going back to EV15 towards Mannheim.
12h - 12h30 Break
13h30 Arriving in Mannheim, visiting the city center. A few nice buildings, the rest is mainly post war architecture.
14h 14h30 Lunch in a Thai street restaurant
14h30 Going through Mannheim on the East side of the Rhine. Lots of heavy industries, chemical plants, etc. 
16h15 Have to cross a river with a chain boat, that's funny. Mainly going through fields now.
16h30 Reaching a tall bridge to go onto the West side of the Rhine. One has has to go up through stairs inside a pillar of the bridgr. I get help from a German guy to push my bike up the stairs, very kind of him.
18h Reaching Worms. Buying food at Lidl. Disappointing non-free public toilets. Beautiful cathedral and lovely alley / parc where one can wander under trees next to the walls of the old town.
19h30 Leaving Worms.
20h30 I find a nice, dry, moskito free place to camp. Was supposed to sleep in a hotel but there is no affordable accomodation nearby. I take care to stay warm though to allow for my recovery.
21h00 Tent is set, I make dinner with lots of tea to help my coughing. Writting to a lot of people. Vast fields in front of me. Windmils with their red light dots in the horizon. Above the infinite sky sparkled with stars. Watching them. Feeling a bit lonely yet very much alive.
I am also a bit frustrated that I can't go as fast as expected. But so it is.
00h00 Sleep

## Day 15

8h00 Waking up, packing, eating a little.
9h15 Departure. Riding on the cycle lane next to the dike inland.
10h Sudden change in landscape and agriculture. The landscape is not so flat anymore as there are hills covered in vineyards in the distance.
11h Reaching Oppenheim
11h15 Breakfast from a bakery, very enjoyable although I cough quite a lot.
11h45 Going. The hills are now much closer to the Rhine on this side, and the route passes through vineyards. Very cool. Then back back to flat wheat and corn fields next to the dike.
12h45 Break sitting on top of the dike in the sun. Sorting housing problems for friends. Giving feet kicks in the air and middle fingers in the open just for the sake of it.
14h Arriving in Mainz. Beautiful city center with an impressive cathedral and old houses. Going around and taking pictures.
15h Break in McDonalds to eat and recharge my phone. Reading Kim. 
17h Going a bit more through Mainz. Also buying food for the night.
19h Leaving Mainz. Very long, large and straight road going through an industrisl sector. Then the route goes through parcel gardens and fields. It smells of late summer, with scents of ripe and rotten fruits.
20h I find a spot for the night on the dike. I would have liked to drive a bit more today but am tired at the same time, and if the current place is convenient, then let's just stop. It's pretty dry, there are moskitoes but not much. Since my tent is still wet from last night, and the weather is good (i.e. no clouds in sight), I decide to sleep in the tent without its roof. It should avoid me being in a super humid environment during the night. Plus I can see the sky through the inner mosquito net. My coughing is a bit better but not gone yet. I must remain careful. Hence dinner features a lot of warm broth and tea. Very pleasant.
Music from biergartens in the distance. 
Speaking French with a Swiss accent and laughing alone.
23h Sleep. 

## Day 16 

8h30 Wake up. I slept pretty well. Wasn't cold despite sleeping roofless. The sky is blue and the Sun bright already. I leave the tent or other material that was wet (from the night or previous days) to dry in the Sun. Breakfast. Also time for a mechanical check of the bike.
Gear shifter: fixed. Tire pressure: checked and set. The day will be hot.
10h30 Going. Still driving next to the dike, but the vegetation is dryer, more yellow. Lots of orchards around, and green hills terminating the horizon.
11h30 Break bakery just before Bingen.
12h Going. Soon after some lovely sights
the Rhine is now right inbetween tall, steep hills, some covered in vineyards. This beautiful scenery unfolds meandre after meandre. I didn't expected to see such "vivacity", "dynamism" and charm in that river after seeing it so large, straight and going through boring flat lands. Argh, too many pictures to take.
15h Buying food in Lidl, snack break in the parking lot. Loading up on cofeine and sugar.
An old guy asks me about his internet problems lmao.
Also practicing duolinguo. Never miss a day or the green owl kills you in your sleep.

16h15 Going again. After a while cofeine kicks. Holy mama. Flash McQueen. Then more chill again.
17h45 Stop at a Biergarten in Boppen, enjoying a beer and their toilets.
18h30 Going again, about twenty kilometers remain until Koblenz, which is my goal for the day. Still so beautiful, wow. And so many castles built on those hills, who had use (and money) for that back in the old days?
20h I'm struggling to find a camping spot and approaching Koblenz. Worst case: sleeping "à la belle étoile", on a bench.
20h45 I finally find a nice spot in a sort of "parc" (or rather a grass field for people to walk their dogs) just before Koblenz, in the industrial outskirts of the city. It is next to the Rhine with some industrial docks on the other side. I will be in quiet there. While setting my things, I see a light and some movement in the distance so I go check what it is. It turns out to be a guy eating his kebap on a bench. We talked for a bit in german, it's pleasant to meet a bit of people. He even offers me to smoke weed with him which I refuse, but that's kinda funny. Then I go back to mounting my camp.
21h30 Setting up everything for the night.
22h30 Eating, the one day aged "in the heat of my bags under the sun" lidl camembert is making wonders for my sandwiches. Hot broth and tea, love it. Lots of boats passing by, some transporting resources and merchandise, others being cruise ships with people dinning or partying on them.
00h30 Sleep

## Day 17

7h30 Waking up. It's my birthday!!!
Making tea in front of the tent, the rising sun warming me up. Packing.
9h00 Going. Passing through tidy and quiet suburbs in sunday morning.
9h15 10h15 Getting breakfast in a bakery. 
10h15 Visiting the city center of Koblenz.
Like many previous cities, a few nice old buildings, the rest is post war architecture i.e. rather ugly. Issue finding (reasonably priced) water on a Sunday since supermarkets are closed. Huge statue of Kaiser Wilhelm in the harbour.
11h30 Not much more to see, leaving Koblenz. 
Passing industrial areas.
12h Fixing an annoying chain squeaking noise on the bike
going along Rhine on cycle path
landscape flattens, hill are smaller and further away from the river
12h30 Bretzel and writing break. I am feeling lazy today.
13h30 Going.
15h 15h15 Snack break.
15h15 Going. The road is along the Rhine. Nothing too special. The day feels a bit stale - but I receive plenty of kind and heartwarming messages for my birthday.
16h15 Issue with a collapsed bridge on the route, I must find an alternative way through an uninteresting small town.
16h45 Stop at McDonalds. I realize that soft drinks are cheaper than water. Eating.
17h30 I go. Lots of people with bikes.
I race a peniche (and win).
Beautiful sunset making grass golden. Some remaining features of the romantic Rhine are still to be seen.
19h00 Entering Bonn outskirts. In particular a huge parc.
19h30 I decide to tour the parc despite all the kms already riden today. Because parcs are great. Yes. This one especially.
20h45 I get to the hostel and check in. Very friendly guy at the desk. I ask him if I could do some laundry despite the hostel not offering it as a service. He is cool with it and put my stinky clothes to wash. Very cool. I take a good shower (was feeling pretty dirty).
22h30 I'm going out to eat something, I'm starving. I find a good kebab place. I'm so hungry and it is so good I take a second kebab.
Friendly atmosphere with lot of people of turkish origin hanging around.
Little walk in the city at night, in particular on the large Kenedybrücke.
00h15 Sleep. Today was my birthday, a rather normal day on the road, but filled with kind messages.

## Day 18

8h30 Waking up. The night in a real bed was good. I would have liked to sleep more but there is stuff to do. I get my clean laundry back, pack my bags, clean my water bottles and check-out from the hostel.
9h45 Leaving the hostel, heading for breakfast in the city center. 
10h Buying food at Aldi, then eating it outside on a bench in a public square.
10h30 Visiting a bit Bonn city enter. There is nothing really noteworthy here. Setting it as the capital of Germany post-WW2 was in a way some sort of humiliation. Also they are really prpud of Bethoven.
11h15 Going from Bonn. The route is still a cycle path on the very side of the Rhine.
11h45 Duolingo and pastry snack break on shore of Rhine. The Sun is really bright, it's a beautiful day.
12h15 Going again. Lot of cyclists and pedestrians on the path. The shore is quite urbanised with villages and industry.
13h15 Crossing a whole chemical plant industrial complex.
14h Fresh forrest before the city of Köln (Cologne pour les francophones). But retarded cycle lane in that forrest: you can just lay bitume 10cm from trees and not expect them to lift and deform the path. Shhh, very annoying ("stupido"). Nice suburb neighbourhoods with lovely houses. Some cool bridges (I have weird interests), as well as re-arranged industrial docks. 
15h30 Reaching the city center. Impressive sight with multiple churches, Hohenzollern bridge and the enormous cathedral. I wander the streets a bit, and then reach the cathedral. 16h Amazing. Magnificient. Grandiose. My mind is blown away by the grandeur of that monument. I go inside to visit. 
16h30 At the detour of a column I see a priest sitted in front of a small table with a sign "discussion" on it. I come to him and start a conversation. He is the vice-bishop of that cathedral. This comes at a prrfect time in my own reflection about religion. Very interesting talk in a mixture of German and French. Before I leave he gives me his benediction.
17h45 Leaving the cathedral in a curious state. My mind is full of thoughts, a bit disconnected from reality on a little cloud - yet very calm and satisfied from the experience I just had - in a certain sense at peace with the world, knowing I am going somewhere and casting a refreshed look on that world, enriched by new perspectives. I still want to go at the summit of the cathedral's tower but it is closed now, too bad.
18h After spiritual food, it is time physical food. I go to McDonalds. I am really not respecting myself, I should eat better. But it's convenient and I know they always have decent toilets to use. Anyway. Eating outside in the square before the cathedral.
18h30 Slowly going towards the North of the city, still taking a few pictures
19h Leaving the city. Passing through parcs on the side of the Rhine. Then next to a large Ford manufacturing site
20h15 Riding again on a dike in nature.
I feel like riding at bit at night, plus all these city visits did not make me progress a lot on the map.
21h Buying a bit of food at Penny.
21h15 Passing by a huge petro-chemical complex, with many tanker peniches aligned on the shore. Also a lot of rabbits wandering around.
21h30 Kebab for dinner (not a good one), writing a bit.
22h30 Going again, changing the batteries on my bike lamp, switching clothing because it is getting cold.
23h15 I find a camping spot.
23h45 The tent is set. The surroundings smell a bit weird. In the distance, the petro-chemical complex is like a city with it's skyline illuminated with thousands lights.
00h30 Sleep

## Day 19

9h00 Waking up. Not a great night but ok.
It's much colder and cloudier than yesterday. I eat a bit (peaches, rice waffles and chocolate) and pack my stuff.
10h45 Going. Riding on the dike, green grass, fresh air.
11h15 Crossing the Rhine West to East on a platform boat, in order to reach Düsseldorf faster. Sun is now peeking out.
11h30 Entering Dusseldorf outskirts
12h Passing through a large park. Parks are great.
12h30 Reaching the old harbour turned into modern and trendy office spaces. Then heading towards te city centre. Lot of police / emergency / firefighter everywhere, weird.
13h City centre. Quite a lot of brick buildings giving a cool industrial vibe. Also lots of pubs, but few bakeries.
13h45 Buying some food at the bakery Hinkel, apparently one of the best in Germany. Very good stuff. Sitting on a bench to eat, next to me an 80y.o. man with whom we start a conversation. We mainly talk about German politics, both local and foreign, present and past. He still has a vivid mind, it is interesting to hear him talk. We get interviewed by a TV chanel about the upcoming elections (I mean he, because I don't know much about current day German politics). He lived his whole life here in Düsseldorf working in textile resale. He now lives alone since his wife is deceased and he has no children. 
14h30 Heading out of town. Going along the Rhine on its Eastern shore, cycle path.
(15h30 Kaiserswerth). Vast, luscious green fields.
16h15 Entering the suburbs of Duisburg. Passing across gardens and residential areas. then industrial areas. The tram looks a bit old fashioned.
17h15 Finally in the actual city, in what seems a popular neighbourhood. It's dirty and ugly, except for a few old buildings that bring some cachet.
17h30 Attaining the center, which is just ugly (not dirty).
17h45 Stopping at McDonalds. Why am I doing that? I must have a problem. It doesn't even taste good. Meeting a Syrian guy doing his master degree in Germany. We talk a bit about what we do, he tells me about the sorry state of affairs in his country. Recharging my phone, reading a bit.
19h30 Going. Taking a few pictures. One can feel that it is just an industrial city. I hurt the back of my feet by hitting the pedal while manoeuvring at low speed. F*cking hurts. It bleeds. Shit.
20h Buying food at Lidl.
20h15 Going again, crossing multiple bridges over the harbour docks.
20h30 Getting annoyed by a seemingly drunken man while taking a picture from a bridge. I carefully "disengage" and avoid his unpredictable and aggressive behaviour. Poor wife of his though, who seems very embarassed next to him.
20h45 Escaping the city by riding on a dike. It is getting dark. Crossing a seemingly drunken cyclist. Overall not a very good impression of that city.
21h15 Passing next to a lot of industry. 
Huge warehouses from which come muffled machinery sounds, and whose tall opaque windows cast light onto the dark cycle path. Tall chimneys shining red light and letting out clouds of dense smoke. The burner of a coal powerplant spits high colorful orange / pink flames into the sky. Very fascinating environment and atmosphere, I love the vibe. Night time makes it even more special. It's hard to capture the atmosphere through pictures though.
22h Setting camp quickly next to the industry. It is not time to ride anymore.
22h30 Done with the camp. Eating dinner, somewhat healthier than McDonalds which feels good. Weather is mild and there are no moskitoes. Some strangers passing by, feeling moderately safe.
00h00 Sleep.

## Day 20

8h30 Waking up. Breakfast, cleaning my feet wound. Packing. I'm very efficient, I like that.
9h45 Going. I make a detour back toward Duisburg to take a picture.
10h45 Detour is done (12km).
OBJECTIVE: reaching the border with the Netherlands. 
Riding. Around is industry industry industry.
Gigantic metal structures.
The air is polluted as indicated by the brownish tint of the sky in the horizon.
11h30 Suddenly plain green nature.
11h45 -12h Sunscreen and snacking break. The day is beautiful.
12h30 Möllen. Signaling is wrong, I end up taking an inland path and shortcuting a meandre.
Lots of red and dark red brick houses.
Riding on cycling lanes next to car roads.
I stop at a crossing to make sure that a truck driver saw me, although I have priority. Meanwhile some ~50yo guy on an e-bike takes over on me by the left. Je lui fume sa #$%& à cet @£^$#@.
13h30 Wesel. Break at bakery with shady outlook but good stuff. Able to charge my phone a bit.
14h Buying water at Penny. Re-packing and tidying the bags.
14h45 Going. Back on EV15.
Riding on the dike with reen fields around, the classic stuff. Sheep, cow, horses. Very buccolic.
Names of places start to change, they sound less German.
I am motivated today.
15h45 Going inland. Quick chit-chat with a ~60yo couple while riding, they indicate me the way.
Flat fields, lots of them.
16h15 Back on dike, green fields (...). Lots of cyclists on day tours, and crazy how many of them have e-bikes (easily >95%).
16h30 Rees. Lovely little brick town with a nice Rhine promenade. Bretzel snack break. Still very motivated.
17h Leaving Rees. Driving on country side roads amidst fields. Some wind turbines around.
17h45 Dike dike dike, you know how it goes.

20h45 Leaving the kebab. I check the Rhine promenade. Taking a picture (that involves some climbing).
21h30 Leaving Emmerich for good.
Riding at night next to the dike. Spooky and maybe slightly dangerous because of the bumps, but I love the thrill of it.
22h I am finally at the border ! Plus I reached 100km cycled today. I'm tired though and struggle to find place to sleep. Also the night is getting cold.
22h30 I find a place in a field. Hope I won't disturb / be disturbed.
23h Tent set.
23h45 Sleep.
