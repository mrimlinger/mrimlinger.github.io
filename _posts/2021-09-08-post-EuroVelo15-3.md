## Bonjour

Plop plip plop, adventures are now related below.


## Day 21

8h30 Waking up. Having a big breakfast (actually the dinner I didn't needed yesterday evening). I fear poisoning myself with the ham that slept overnight in my bag but if should be okay. Writing the travel journal and putting it online. Packing.
10h45 I depart and pass by the DE-NL border.
11h45 Hot chocolate break in a biergarten next to the Rhine in Tolkamer. Charging my phone.
Very peaceful and enjoyable. People speak a curious language here. The Sun is bright.
13h15 Going. I am actually not on EV15 but it doesn't matter, I'll reach it back later. The Netherlands seem to have lots of good and well mapped cycling lanes. Each crossing of lanes makes a numbered knot with a physical map on a sign. Hence, it is not an issue to go in the right direction, one can just make a sequence of nodes to travel the graph (#DES).
From there onwards the Rhine splits into multiple arms which are themselves linked by man-made canals, therefore becoming a watery mess. Crossing villages and small towns full of brick buildings. I am tempted to say that in a nutshell, the NL are flat, green and watery, but let's not be too hasty in judgement.
The grass looks softer than in Germany.
14h45 Bridge to Arnhem. Small industrial zone. Face wind.
15h15 Arriving at the city center of Arnhem.
15h45 Buying some food at Spar. What a pleasure not having to wear a mask.
I notice that people are more beautiful, have finer traits than elsewhere (?). Buying more food in a bakery. Chill time. City center is nothing spectacular but nice with all the colourful brick buildings.
16h45 Going.
17h00 Passing through some very peaceful and cute neighborhoods (Osterbeek).
17h15 Out of town, beautiful nature. The route goes along the junction between flat fields and a forest. The cycling lanes are very good and always well defined on the ground (often with a grapefruit orange red color).
18h45 Out of Wageningen I fall from the bike while stopping on the side. Very stupid but nothing dramatic.
(19h Rhenen. 19h15 Out.)
Very boring drive through a forest with some ups and downs. It is slowly getting dark, I must find a place for the night.
20h30 I go knock on a farm's door to ask for permissin to camp on their fields. Here comes an old man who only speaks dutch. I can understand little bits that are similar to German, but overall not much. He seems kind and friendly. I try to make myself understoodbut without success. I'll go check somewhere else. While departing I see someone leaving from a nearby field with a car. I rush on the dirt road to ask that person if the field belongs to them. A woman ~40yo tells me that it doesn't, but she knows the farmer with whom I talked previously. She offers to ask him for me. So we go back to the old farmer together and she does the translation / diplomacy business.
21h Permission is granted to me. I heartily thank the farmer. Then I still talk a bit with the lady who shows me the exact spot where I can lay my tent. She is a vet and was taking care of sheeps in a traditional dutch sheep pen. I thank her manytimes. I set the camp for tonight.
21h30 Tent is set. I notice that I lost my blue fleece sweater during the day :/ .
Eating dinner. Flavored spreadable wedge cheese and chocolate sandwich, to be honest I have seen better.
Hot broth soup is nice.
23h30 Sleep.

## Day 22

7h45 Waking up. Breakfast. Packing. I book a hostel for the upcoming night in Rotterdam - I really want to take a shower. This means I have a long day ahead of me to get there. I'm greeted by the old armer who is passing by the field. We attempt to communicate in Dutch / German.
9h15 Going. Fresh cloudy morning.
10h15 Wijk. Poor signaling of EV15 in the city, I loose it for a bit, wasting some time.
10h45 Taking a platform ferry boat on a canal. I like the smell of steel and gasoline, and the rumbling sound of its engine. It must have taken the Dutch a crazy amount of effort to arrange and control all the waterways in the country. The canals make like a watery road network. Then passing through some very nice country side. Sheeps. Windmills.
11h45 Buren. Very charming little village. I stop at a butcher shop, drawn by some pulled pork burger on display. Omg is it good. Eating break.
12h15 Going again. 
12h45 Buying (more) food at lidl.
13h30 Going. I am very sceptical as to the route planning of EV15 in this area. It makes significant detours through places where there is really nothing special to see. I would have the same overall experience by following some random, more straightforward cycling lanes towards my destination. Quite retarded imo. Anyway I still want to trust EV15. Face wind while going West. Shite. It feels like the world is a gainst me despite doing my best. A few windmills.
14h15 Beautiful tiny hamlets on the shore of a small river. Some white houses with straw roofs. Rain / storm seems to be coming.
14h30 It rains. Big drops. I find shelter and wait until it passes.
15h Going again, the rain has stopped.
15h45 Passing near Leerdam. Moving forward. Trying to be fast. My left knee hurts a bit though.

14h30 It rains. Big drops. I find shelter and wait until it passes.
15h Going again, the rain has stopped.
15h45 Passing near Leerdam. Moving forward. Trying to be fast. My left knee hurts a bit though.
17h Gorinchem. Stopping at McDonalds. I need sugar, to use their toilets and to charge my phone.
17h30 Going. I feel re-energized and my knee hurts less.
18h15 I make the (uttermostly important) decision to follow EV15 on its path madness, instead of going straight to Rotterdam. This implies taking a {first boat} accross the Bowen Merwede, wandering a bit of {countryside}, going through a {national park}, and then taking {another boat} to Dordrecht since the aforementionned countryside and park are waterlocked in direction of Rotterdam. Then I shall be again on a direct path to Rotterdam. My idea is that it should be nice and worth seeing, and I want to trust EV15 (spoiler: in retrospect this was a mistake). Before jumping on the first boat, I make sure that the second boat will still be running when I get there, in order not to remain stuck on the waterlocked piece of land. All is good, boat cruising is fun.
18h30 Arrival with the boat in Woudrichem.
Nice little village with old wooden boats in its harbour. I have about an hour and a half to get to the second boat. It is feasible, I must simply not waste time. I go quite fast, running on the previously eaten McDonald and the adrenaline of the clock ticking. The {countryside} bit is really not interesting, I'm starting to have doubts regarding the worthiness of all this. I shortcut it a little bit to get to the national park quicker and gain time.
19h30 There comes the tricky point. Or catastrophy shall I say. To get into the national park through EV15 which I am following, one must cross a tiny river onto a tiny boat which I tiny overlooked when planning all this. And it turns out this boat is closed since 18h00. And there is no quick way to get into the {national park} (would have been possible by shortcuting the {countryside} part... which was uninteresting -> f@#$ you EV15) and then out of the waterlocked area. I will miss the last connection. I am screwed. La Beresina (that's actually a good analogy). I want to google "EV path sucks" to feel less alone in my complaint but I have almost no battery left on my phone. And my sweater is wet from sweat. And I have already cycled 90km today. And I can't cancel tonight's booking in Rotterdam and get a refund. Nothing goes right.
19h45 I resign myself and go again, determined. I will get that hot shower and that night of sleep in a soft bed. I go more or less back on my tracks, the only way to escape the waterlocked part being a highway bridge to Gorinchem i.e. from where I came before the first boat. Morale: a (travel) path is a path, there is no right or wrong one, and one should not over-rely on existing ones but sometimes dare to go its own one. In other words: f*&% you EV15, I'm done with you, now I go my own way straight to Rotterdam.
20h15 Another boat crossing that would have helped me by shortcutting some distance is already closed too - what did I expect. Light is decreasing. The evening is grey, foggy and humid i.e. pretty sad.
20h30 Crossing the bridge that goes over the Waal back to Gorinchem. Vacarm of the highway traffic on the bridge. The night is falling. Then heading West, straight towards Rotterdam. No time for sightseeing anymore. The cycling lane down a dike is full of fog under some street lamps, very special spooky atmosphere.
21h15 Stopping at a McDonalds, I need energy to reach Rotterdam. The break macht Spass.
21h45 Going once more. Singing some French variety songs out loud to give myself some courage (#MagicSystem #Sardou). Lot of industrial areas, etc.
22h15 By some coincidence I end up crossing EV15. But no time to bother, I continue.
22h30 Asking a young guy about the straightest path to Rotterdam. There is indeed a cycling lane following the highway towards it. That's perfect. Actually I notice that there are cycling lanes everywhere, along all roads, etc. Very impressive, it is really the country of cyclists (everybody cycles, and with "classic" non electric bikes). And I must say that despite all the troubles encountered today, I really like the Netherlands so far. It seems like a wealthy, quiet and enjoyable place to live.
23h30 Residential areas. Slowly getting nearer to the city's heart. Riding in the quiet night.
00h Passing the bridges over the multiples branches of the Nieuwe Maas in the middle of the city. There Rotterdam reveals itself. 
Arriving in a city for the first time at night is always peculiar (cf. Urumqi, Tchelyabinsk). Since the layout and organization of the city cannot easily be grasped at sight, everything seems bigger, more mysterious and intriguing, sometimes threatening too. Walls of lights with futuristic shapes moving relative to each other as I progress deeper into the concrete jungle. Finally entering a maze of small streets and pathways amidst weird architectural constructions. There I find my hostel in the yellow cubes of Piet Bloom.
00h45 Checking in. Eating a bit outside. My legs are painful. 144km ridden today. To the dorm, but I'm too tired to even go to sleep. What a day. Texting. 03h00 Sleep.

## Day 23

A (much needed) rest day. Waking up ~9h to get the hostel breakfast (very enjoyable feasting). Extending the reservation. Then going back to bed until 15h.
Buying some food at Lidl and battling to bring a pack of water to the hostel on my bike. It is grey, cold and windy outside. Then I go wandering around the city a bit by foot. It is overall very modern with fancy architectural experiments. Sometimes it is ugly, yet it is always daring and original. My legs hurt (expectingly). Buying train tickets at the Centraal Station for the way back home to Zurich. The matter is not so simple because of the bike (allowed / not allowed, reservation, etc.).
There is a weird atmosphere in the city, as if its soul lied in modernity, and yet that modernity took the soul of life away. Probably the dark grey weather doesn't help. Godlessness. Night falls. 
Eating a kebab from a Uyghur chef (my intuition on Asiatic facial features is pretty damn good). Then having a beer and reading Kim in the hostel hall. Someday I will cycle India and reach the Himalayas. 
The hostel is full of "weshs en jogging" which seem very veree stupid, I am really not motivated to go talk with them. 
Sleeping too late ~2h30.

## Day 24

8h30 Waking up.
9h30 Breakfast of the hostel. Very nice. Feeling sad though. Packing my bags.
11h00 Checking out. Touring a bit Rotterdam harbour, taking pictures. Not very inspired. My legs are still sore from the 144km of the day before yesterday.
12h00 On the Erasmus bridge, while looking at the skyline, I inavertedly crush my hand between the handlebar of the bike and the railing. This painful experience results in the stripping away of half a centimeter square of superficial skin from my hand. Fortunately the Dutch doppelganger of Morgan Freeman passes by and ask me how I'm doing - this brings a smile back onto my face.
12h15 Driving, the day is gray and fresh. I am really feeling down. I have mixed feelings about going back to Zurich.
12h30 Buying food at AH, eating it on the pavement in front of the supermarket.
13h Going. Kilometers of residential areas. Nothing interesting really. There is a strong face wind, making my progression slow and tedious. I am tired and a bit fed up, not a good mood.
14h Cycling lane on the shore. At least now the sight is better. Some fancy modern buildings here and there. Also some wind turbines. The Sun ends up showing.
15h Coming near the Europoort (one of Europe's largest trade port). My foot hurts for idk what reason. The wind blows, the wind turbines turn, and I suffer. Some much bigger boats, those huge container ships. I pass by the Maeslant barrier, with its two gigantic steel arm meant to protect Rotterdam and the innerland from floods.
15h15 15h45 Snack break.
16h15 Finally at the hook of Holand! 
There the Rhine is terminated by a long pier going into the north sea.
I wish I would arrive in a better mood / condition, but hey it's not too bad. And I get the satisfaction of reaching the end of the journey.
I spend some time on the pier contemplating the see and the surroundings.
17h45 I decide to go dip my feets in the ocean. Very pleasant to feel the sand and fresh water.
18h15 Le coup de Trafalgar. I cut my feet on some seashell debri. I go back to the bike limping and swearing. Blood spilling out of the wound. I clean and disinfect the wound on the spot, but I'm afraid that something is still inside.
19h The Sun is getting low. I must go towards The Hague where my hostel is booked.
I can't pedal properly because of my feet (must use the heel instead of the sole on the pedal), but it is still okay to move forward. The way goes on sand dunes next to the sea, very beautiful. 
20h Entering the city. I go slowly, how I can.
21h00 Buying food at AH. Quick snack break.
21h30 Check-in at the hostel. Enjoying a hot shower. I feel bruised, cut and scratched all over. Maybe that's enough adventures for now. Dinner and writing.
1h30 Sleep.

## Day 25

8h30 Some A-hole in the dorm left his alarm ringing for a darn long time.
9h15 Feeding on the Philoseph's wisdom.
9h30 Going out of bed. Breakfast.
10h Extending my reservation. Then leaving for the hospital because I think my foot needs a medical check-up. I'm limping pretty badly. Fortunately the hospital is a few hundred meters away and I have my bike to get there.
10h30 Checking-in at the emergencies. Reading in the waiting room, soon I get taken care of by a general practitioner. She looks into the wound and removes some debris of shell with a tweezer while bite my finger to not focus too much on the work being dobe. Unfortunately she doesn't know if everything is out. I'm being sent for X-rays.
11h Checking-in as a hospital patient this time, then going for the X-ray radiography. The dtaff is very friendly and speaks perfectly well English. Back in the emergency waiting room.
12h Second round with the same general practicioner. It turns out I have a 11mm long shard stuck about 1cm deep inside the soft tissues of my foot. Great. She performs a local anesthesia - s#$% does the injection hurts. She is very kind and friendly with me.
She then tampers inside the wound trying to remove the foreign object, but without success. She sends me to the "action side" of the emergency, where they have more experience dealing with such problems.
12h30 Back in the emergency waiting room. Reading.
13h15 Being picked up by another doctor to the other side. She too tries to remove the shard, by pressing the tissues and by going inside the wound with tweezers. This is quite painful. She adds more anesthetic directly into the wound. Cold sensation. She too is very friendly. She tries again and again. This feels more and more like a butchery. Finally she gives up as she can't get a grip on the thing to pull it out. Taking it out would require opening the wound more, which is not desirable. I will have to wait until my body ejects it naturally - it might well take a good month.
13h45 Back to the waiting room. My feet is painful from all the tinkering inside, despite the anesthetic.
14h Out of the emergencies. I go to the drugstore next door to buy some plasters. It is a real nightmare to walk.
14h30 Buying some food at the supermarket. 
My foot is becoming more and more painful as the effect of the anaestetic wears off.
15h Back af the hostel. Laying in bed all afternoon. Watching Rick and Morty. Reading. Cool hostel vibes. Meeting and discussing with a Brasilian guy immigrating in the Netherlands, currently living from doing Uber Eats. Brave guy. Later at dinner in the hostel kitchen I also meet with a Belgian medicine student travelling here - it's nice to talk in French. Reading. Good shower.
01h00 Sleep.

## Day 26

01h Sleep
9h30 Waking up
10h30 Checking out of the hostel.
Breakfast.
11h The weather is nice, I decide to go back to Rotterdam by bike, yet slowly because of my foot.
12h30 Passing through the campus of TU Delft.
Feeling low and tired.
14h30 Check in at the hostel in Rotterdam.
In the dorm I meet Baran, a young turkish guy studying law in London. We go eating out in the market. I feel better.
16h Going out on a mission to find Stroopwafels. Fortunately my bike can carrh me around, otherwise I'd be limpinv too much. Talking with people here and there in the shops, trying to find a lead towards the best wafels in town.
20h30 Kebab dinner. Chilling on a bench.
22h Taking night pictures.
23h Back at the hostel. Briefly sympathising with another guy of the dorm who is from China and will start studying design here. Complaining altogether about the noise outside of the dorm. Shower. Preparing for tomorrow's early departure.
01h Sleep.
