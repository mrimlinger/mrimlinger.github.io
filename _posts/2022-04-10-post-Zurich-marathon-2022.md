A few chronological notes:
- A morning run, start at 8:15am in the cold ~5°C.
- About 4000 participants for the full distance i.e. not too many, simple atmosphere "come and run".
- First real marathon since a long time, thank you covid.
- No specific target time in mind, I just want to finish it and challenge myself.
- I manage to get passed the 4h00 pace flag, I will try to stay ahead of it.
- Quite some people cheering in the city and villages, thank you dear strangers :)
- Some brass bands playing in the villages along the lake, really cool!
- Perfect weather ~10°C + Sun.
- Good catering along the way, this helps for sure.
- The 30 km wall, from there things get complicated.
- My theory: the {pleasure vs distance} and {pain vs distance} curves cross each other around this point.
- One kilometer after another, I should not stop running.
- Approaching the finish line, summit of joy and pain mixed together, I increase the pace.
- 3h50m56s, so happy that I managed to go below the 4h threshold.
- Ich bin stolz und zerstört.
