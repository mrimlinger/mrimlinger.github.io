It is summer time, and for the little vacation time that I have this year I have decided to cycle down the Rhone (Eurovelo route 17). Here is the journal of that journey:

## Preparation:
31st of August - Last exam (game theory and control), thank you ETH for spoiling my summer. I already start packing and preparing for the trip.
1st, 2nd of September - I spend most these two days preparing and packing for the journey.
In particular I want to install a dynamo and converter system to allow me to charge my phone while I drive during the day. This should allow me to save some time by not having to stop for too long in cafés, bars, restauranys, etc. during tge day and hence be able to ride longer.
I have previously bought all the components, now I just need to install them on the bike. I manage to do so in quite a clean and satisfactory way. The dynamo (bottle type) is fixed to the frame and contacts with the rear wheel. The cables then run from the dynamo to a small waterproof bag located under the saddle. In there is an AC to DC converter with a USB output that goes to a powerbank to store those hard earned joules. I didn't have time to test it yet, but I hope that it will work!

EV17 officially starts at Andermatt, at XXXXm in the Swiss Alps. From there, one then has to climb up to the Furkapass at 2436m, which is close to where the Rhone glacier. But before starting this journey, I have a choice to make: I can either take the train as far up as possible i.e. to Andermatt, or I can start at the four cantons lake and climb all the way up to Andermatt. I feel like the latter is a bit more fair game, therefore I decide to take up the challenge.

## Day 1 (03/09/2022):
10h After settling a few more things at the flat regarding the arrival of new tenants, I finally depart from home. The weather is nice, fresh and sunny just after the rain.
I am getting used to the loaded bike's physic once again.
10h35 IR75 train from Zurich HB to Zug.
11:02-11h05 Quick train change in Zug, a bit technical for handling all the bags and the bike while catching the connection.
As the train goes along the lake of Zug, some heavy grey clouds are looming in the distance - I hope the weather won't be too bad once in the mountains.
11h50 Arrival in Flüelen, at the South-East end of the four cantons lake.
Strong wind from the North at 40km/h, max 60km/h. Temperature is a bit fresh at 19°C.
I start riding south into the valley with the wind in my back (fortunately).
12:15 It (already) starts to rain, what a great start for the trip. I find shelter in a pedestrian tunel under the highway and put on the rain clothing. The strong wind engulfing in the tunnel overturns my bike, first scratches (some damage on the gear shifter lever). I move forward under the rain.
12h45 The rain is over, in the end it was not that bad. So far the valley is very broad and flat bottomed. There is quite a lot of industry and a highway that the cycling route goes along for a bit. Nice modern suspended bridge over the Reuss river, my fellow civil engineers would have liked that.
Progressively the surroundings start feeling more like true countryside with the highway hidden from view, large fields, some cute chalets, cows. I am happy like a kid seeing all this! Overall this is such a drastic change from city life and the university; I feel alive and wonder how did I keep my sanity so far.
13:30 Nearing the end of the valley's flat bottom.
I can see a traffic jam on the highway that leads to the Gotthard tunnel. From there the climb starts - a sign writes: "cyclist 1560m 34km". The route enters a narrow valley with steep slopes and a torrent at the bottom. There is no dedicated cycling infrastructure, the veloroute uses the same road as the cars. I must remain concentrated to keep a straight trajectory on the side of road. Some small periods of light rain with sun, nothing to disturbing. Infrastructures in this valley are crazy: normal road, highway, train tracks - all going on vertiginous bridges, passing through deep tunnels and lacing on the flanks of the valley.
15h Reaching Wassen, snack break. I meet Detlef and Werner, two germans in their sixties who are also climbing up to Andermatt and aim at reaching Italy.
There is a lot of traffic on the road, it is so far not very pleasant to ride. But the scenery is already great though! Also the drivers are generally quite respectful.
Also, consequence of all the traffic, the air is not so fresh and pure.
15h25 Still driving on the main road with cars, there is absolutely no infrastructure meant for cyclists. At this point the road goes in a long dark tunnel, I must step down from the bike and walk alongside it on the tiny sidewalk of the tunnel. Staying on the road would be borderline suicidal.
15:45 Göschenen. I buy some groceries at Coop (tomorrow is Sunday, I must stack up). I also go to a local bakery held by an old lady and get some "urner pastete" (very dense layered pastry with dried raisins inside, just the fat and sugar I need to climb up). I pause at the exit of the village to eat it before the final ascent to Andermatt. It starts to rain very heavily. I meet with a belgian lady who is going the other way i.e. down. I am roughly midway in the climbing (800m - 800m), I can feel some tiredness in my muscles.
Ahead the mountain is a vertiginous, steep rocky wall with an incised gorge. The road engulfs right into it through many bridges, laces and tunnel. The climb is going to be very hard.
16:30 I start under the heavy rain. Fortunately, the veloroute now has dedicated infrastructures, either a marked cycle lane on the road, or a separated cycle path.
Soon after though, I make another break to eat a sandwich while waiting for the rain to pass as I am sweating too much under my coat due to the hard climb. I meet again the two germans, we take a picture together.
17h I go again. The climb is long and very steep, this is hard. The veloroute takes the old road to Andermatt, this is very nice.
17:35 The impressive Teufelsbrucke, this means the worst is now over. This is the place where I started my Rhine trip last year. Some damaged signs at the memorial, as well as traces of blue and yellow paint.
18h00 Finally in Andermatt, I made it!!! Here is the official start of the Eurovelo route 17 (EV17). Lot of rich people around.
18:15 Filling up my water bottles at the village foutain, I love this about Switzerland. Temperature is colder up there, about 14°C.
It starts to rain, I find shelter and wait for the rain to pass. I also put on some warmer clothes.
19:00 The rain stops, there is even some sun and blue sky, but the air is fresh. The weather tonight should be good. I go again in direction West, into the Reuss valley. It is rather flat and the landscape is beautiful, the ride is enjoyable.
20h It is getting dark, especially with the tall mountains blocking the Sun. I stop near a few stone pasture houses, and ask an old local farmer / shepherd if I can camp here. He speaks with a heavy swiss-german accent and doesn't seem to fully understand what I tell him in high german. Although he seems a bit cold and grumpy at first, once he understands that I want to plant a tent, he is very kind to me and shows me a location where I can do so.
20:15 I mount the tent and set up camp, prepare dinner. [PB] The gas canister that I bought hastily the day before departure has the wrong adapter type for my stove. Therefore no hot drink (broth, tea) for me tonight, this is quite a bummer, I was really hoping for something warm after this strenuous day.
20:45 Dinner: cheese spread and cervela sandwich, peanut butter and chocolate sandwich.
21:15 Brushing my teeths, then going to bed. I am very tired yet feeling great, I am happy to be there starting this adventure.
23h Some rain. The night is cold at ~7°C. I do not sleep so well and wake up a few times. Later at night the sky is full of stars.

## Day 2:
6:30 Waking up naturally, it is cold, I wait impatiently for the sun to warm me up. Everything is covered in morning dew. I go take a few pictures.
7:15 The sun is progressively reaching lower into the valley as the shadow from the moutain crest retreats.
7:30 Starting to pack everything, eating breakfast.
8:15 Finally the sun hits, so pleasant, all the
moisture from the night gets dried up.
9:00 I go, soon I reach Realp. Refilling my water bottles at the fountain. From there starts the climb to the Furkapass (sign says: 890m, 13km). I drive on the main road but there is not too much traffic, so it is okay. The road is in laces with a breathtaking view on the Reuss valley. The slope is equally breathtaking. The weather is sunny, but the air is cold once sun is hidden.
10:15 Break at the closed hotel Gallenstock and its breathtaking view on the valley. Snack.
Around are some chalets that are not chalets but disguised bunkers of the Swiss army.
10:30 Go. The are no more laces, the road now borders the flank of the mountain, still going up though
11:15 Quick snack. The slopes are very steep, at the limit of what I can pedal with the loaded bike. Many small breaks. It's fucking hard. (...)
11:50 Furkablick, finally the top! Hot chocolate with amazing view (5chf).
12:15 I go a bit further to the pass. Here lies the border between canton Uri and Vallis. Taking a picture in front of the sign. Talking with a few people around. Close to the pass is the Rhone glacier, but one cannot see it from there. The view on the other side into Vallis is just as impressive, it is like a circus surrounded by steep mountains, and at the bottom of which flows the Rhone torrent.
12:40 Going down, still on the main mountain road that goes down in laces on the extremely steep mountain flanc. Such adrenaline omg, the loaded bike can go quite fast. I must be careful to control my speed though, this could be dangerous with the turns and the traffic. This is going to wear down my brakes quite a lot. Viewpoint on the cascade that stems from the Rhone glacier.
13:10 Gletsch, at the bottom and exit of this first small valley / "circus". From there downhill continues, but now in a forest of pines
13:30 Obergoms. I arrive in a flat bottomed valley where the rhone flows as a big torrent. My hand and wrists are broken from continuous breaking and vibrations of the handlebar. Weather is amazing with sunny air and 20°C.
14:00 Lunch on a bench next to the Rhone. I put my hands in the water: it is very cold.
14:30 Go, nice path on the side of the valley's flat. It is quiet (except for the distant reverberation of a road).
Villages feature lots of chalets, some old and traditional, others more modern.
Also there are lots of campings along the path.
15:30-16h The valley narrows itself with some gorges, and the route becomes an awful mountain bike path not at all suited for my bike. Some slopes I cannot ride and must Once my bike falls as I walk aside it on a slope, very upsetting.
16h Nice little traditional villages. The route is once again better.
16h30 Ernen, zvieri break.
17h00 Go, riding on normal road, little front wind at times, some slight climbing. The route wanders into a side valley where the river Binna flows.
17h30 Passing in front of the opening of a tunnel that blows really cold air. The veloroute leaves the road and goes downhill on a small steep walking path in the forest. Primary business on a forgotten path. The way down is super steep and chaotic, I step down and push (or rather hold) the bike. Beautiful old pedestrian stone bridge going across the Binna river. Then super steep path going up, I push the bike up but my feet keep sliding backwards on the path. Ugh, all of this is taking forever and I am getting tired. Pushing for a while.
18:15 Dirt path is getting better, I can ride again on it. Beautiful little chapel part of a pilgrimage path.
18:30 Dirt track is finally over, now it is a dirt road. Landscape is beautiful. I am tired, I make a break, then decide to eat dinner (spread cheese and cervela sandwich). I was hoping to go further today, at least beyond Brig, but given the difficulty of the road this will be all for now.
20:30 The place is actually suitable for camping (on the side of a mountain dirt road), although I am at first a bit worried that some local farmer driving drunk at night might crash is car there. But it should be ok, there is almost no one passing by. I mount the tent.
21:30 I go to sleep. During the night the sky is clear and full of stars. The valley is quiet except for an occasional car far away or the bells of the cows. Temperature is also much better than last night as I am mich lower in altitude.

## Day 3:
Today is my birthday!!!
8:30 Waking up, I had am amazing good and long night of sleep. Breakfast, then packing up. I wash my face in a small river.
10:00 Go. Some steep downhill parts. Lovely little paved road going through hamlets of chalets. Going down laces. Weather is nice and sunny.
10h45 Bottom of the steep valley, I notice thay my brakes definitively took a hit over the past two days.
11h Bitsch, I now enter a large flat bottomed valley. Here there are no more cute little chalets, but rather ugly concrete buildings and much more industry.
11:15-45 Groceries shopping and suncreaming myself. Nice cycle path on a former train track going across the city of Brig
About Brig: not much aesthetically interesting things to see except for a big castle and a few older houses in the city center. The city is surrounded by mountains, and one can see a bit of a glacier in the distance. I try to find suitable gas canisters for my stove but without success.
12:15-30 Breakfast n°2 with a view on the city.
12:45 Back on EV17 as I had lost it in the city. Riding alongside the Rhone on an old car road with no traffic. Lots of trees providing shadow, very nice and buccolic.
13:15 DSM chemical industry. The sun hits hard but the air is ok, fresh enough.
14:00 Meet an australian couple Mak and Elois who are also traveling by bike along the Rhone.
14:30 Cycling amidst fields in the flat of the valley and along the river. Vineyards on the lower sides of the valley. Drier vegetation than before.
14:45 Raron. Beautiful village at the edge of the valley's bottom, with church high up on a rocky promontory.
15:15 Still 20km until Sierre, and 38km until Sion. Riding a dirt road shadowed by trees on the dike of the Rhone.
15:45 Making a stop to dip my feet in the Rhone's water (there shouldn't be any seashells here). The water is grey due to all the alluvials caried from the mountains. It feels great but the water is very fresh, I can't leave my feet in there to long. Drying in a tiny gray beach whose texture is clay like. Phonecall from some weirdo distant relative who is really angry at me for some hardly justifiable reason. That #$%&* @ even forgets to wish me my birthday.
16:15 Go. Driving on a large car road with lot of traffic. Going down, there is like a step in the valley's flat. Surrounding vegetation on this small part is mostly pines whose scent reminds me of the South.
16:45 Leuk. I realize I'm in a pretty bad mood after that phonecall, although I should not pay much attention to it. It's just hard since this has been my only vocal social contact of the day. Thanks for spoiling my birthday.
17:10 Reaching Sierre, little break on a nice place where people play pétanque.
17:40 Go. The veloroute is now a path on the dike along the left side of Rhone's flowing direction. Thanks to the other, I now feel quite pressured by the fact that I have to reach Lausanne by tomorrow evening, which is not really nice. Physical strain is already enough with this mode of travel,
####################
19:00 Reaching Sion's outskirts, it somehow feels american. I am a bit bothered that the Coop supermarket is already closed, but no big deal though. EV17 route doesn't pass by the center of the city, I therefore assume that there is not much to see. Anyway I must move forward as I want to cover more distance in order to reach Lausanne in time. Lots of wine companies. The sun passes behind the mountain crest.
19:15 Exit Sion. I pass in front of a few homeless punks under a bridge. I continue on the dike.
19:30 Micro water break. I keep moving mindlessly forward, swallowing kilometer after kilometer. It has been so long since I last eat (especially considering a cyclist's eating rythm). I wonder what I'm running on... probably my cheeks lol.
20:00 Micro water break again. There are lots of orchards on my left. The valley's flat bottom is widening. Comeback of my old friends the moskitoes, they were not missed so far.
20:15 It is getting dark, I put the lights on. I must be careful for all kind of road obstacles. I see a small wild animals pasding in front of me.
21:00 I find a camping spot in an orchard, close to what seems to be a military base. I adjust the tent position such that the long parallel tree rows are not too creepy. I mount tent in the dark [!] always pay attention to overhead electric lines when handling the tent poles. I see some lights some lights slowly approaching. These are people walking their dog, and the dog in question starts coming towards me, barking angrily. It is a medium size dog, pretty thick and muscular, unleashed. Having been bitten by a dog lately, I am legitimately scared. I stop moving and stare at the dog who remains at a few meters but keeps barking. The dog's owner helplessly tells it to calm down, and it takes a good few doubtful minutes before the dog backs away.
I would have hoped for a funnier encounter, like some swiss military service guys or something like that.
I take some deep breath as I get relieved from the stress - I had a good adrenaline kick.
Now the serious business: preparing dinner. I have some crisps ("birthday crisps") which feel amazing since I am starving. I start preparing sandwiches. Unfortunately, the ham package that was in my bag all day has inflated, I must throw it away. Very sad. At least vegies don't betray you. Then it will just be spread cheese and tomato sandwich, and peanut butter with dark chocolate sandwich for dessert. But before eating I first call my brother, father and stepmother. I'm in a better mood after that phonecall.
I also reply to many of the kind messages that I received for my birthday.
22:30 I finaly eat something, while still answering to messages.
23:45 Sleep.
Also a great news: today was the first day that I tested the dynamo system of the bike, and it works!!! I manage to get a partial phone charge from the powerbank.

## Day 4:
8:00 Waking up.
9:15 I start riding. In broad daylight, I realize that what I thought was a miliyary base was in fact just a chicken farm. Sunny weather.
9:45 Passing near martigny, the valley makes an L turn. Fillimg my wager bottles. Ahead are some big grey clouds in the valley. Cycle path is paved and goes beyween the highway and the Rhone.
10:30 St-Moritz. I do some groceries shopping at Migros, then I stop at a bakery and get myself a nice piece of plum pie (3.80).
[PB] I realize that the dynamo system is not working anymore: the rubber cap of the bottle dynamo is already worn out by the fiction against the tire.
11:00 Go. Big heavy threatening rain clouds are facing me. It starts to rain, I find shelter next to a farm and eat my pie along a cold latte. In the end there is not so much rain, I keep going without having to put on the whole rain apparel.
12:00 Aigle. I am making good progress distance-wise.
13:00 Crossing an old style metallic bridge just before the Rhone's mouth into the Leman lake.
13:15 Villeneuve, city on the shore of the lake.
14:00 Montreux. I eat lunch (reblochon cheese and cervela sandwich, zweifel crisps) with a nice view on the lake and the castle of Chillon.
14:30 Go. Driving on the main big road with cars, there isn't always a cycle lane, not cool.
15:15 Vevey, cycle path on the shore of the lake, very nice.
15:30 Starting to go up into the vineyards. Some climbing. Actually lots of climbing.
The view is nice, the environment super charming, but honestly at times the route takes unecessary detours with ups and downs, some of which are just not managable with a loaded bike - I must push it under the obliterating afternoon sun. Slope after slope. Phone runs out of battery.
Lausanne is not far in distance as the crow flies, but with that kind of route it is taking forever. Charming vineyards villages though. At some point I leave EV17 so that I can go towards my aunt's place, which is behind and obove Lausanne. Many very difficult slopes, I'm dying. Plus I'm driving on the road with cars, and sometimes it is quite narrow, especially in the slopes. Finally I reach some sort of hilly plateau, I struggle a bit to find my way but it's ok.
18:15 Arrival at my aunt Cathy's, I receive a warm welcome (despite her partner getting upset at the neighbours and screaming that he's going to kill them, before he finally calms down). She kindly offers to wash my clothes. I have a good shower, and then we have a good meal together (guacamole and tortilla crisps, lasagna, good wine, some small cakes). I eat like a bottomless pit, also listening to the usual bs of the other. Then tiredness gets the best of me and I head towards a comfy bed.
22:30 Sleep, I am KO. A real bed never felt so good.

## Day 5:
8:00 Waking up, I had an amazing night. Good stretch. breakfast with Patrick, preparing stuff, shaving, giving a phone call to my fatherside grandparents.
10:00 I depart from my aunt's, farewell to Patrick. I go downhill in towards Lausanne. I pass by the Cathedral, and there I talk with a charming girl who is also into cycle travel. I keep going down towards the city center and the lake. [PB] My brake pads are really worn out, in particular the rear one doesn't brake anymore, which in Lausanne is a bit scary. [OBJ] My objectives for the morning are to get an appropriate gas canister, to change my brake pads, and to find postcards to send to the flat (in order to refresh the decoration). I quickly lay my hands on some postcards in a small shop near the cathedral. Then in Bächli (sport equipment shop) I find the gas canister. Finally in a bike store (Tandem) I buy some break pads. I still have to find a way to install them - they cannot do it right away and anyway this would be too costly.
I go down to Ouchy and then ride along the lake up to the EPFL campus. This brings back so much good memories. Plus that scenery with the mountains on the lake is amazing as always.
12:30 I meet Florian, we have a nice lunch from the Thai foodtruck, which we eat seated on the new tribune above the place Cosandey. Then we get some coffee in the architects' building.
14:30 I go to check whether point vélo (the bike repair workshop of the university) is open. They are open today but currently all the staff is eating, they kindly tell me to pass later and until then to enjoy a drink at Sat. I follow this wise advice and go to Sat where I drink a syrup (heresy I know). I also see some people whom I knew a bit from my bachelor.
Later I go back to point vélo, they let me in and I can use all their tools to fix my stuff. The people here are very helpful and kind to me - they show me where tools are and how to do certain things that I struggle with.
After successfully changing my brake pads, I also seize the opportunity to lubricate my chain and check my tires' pressure.
16:30 I am done with bike maintenance and pretty proud of it. I pass by the Aumonerie to see if someone is there, and luckily I meet Alexandre there, pastor and acquaintance from my time at EPFL. We have a great discussion together.
18:30 I buy some groceries at the campus' Migros, then I start going again.
Mainly riding along the main large road along the lake. Very good cycling lanes, I am going at an easy pace to recover a bit from the previous days that were quite intense. Weather announces bad weather tonight.
Later the route takes some smaller roads in vineyards and orchards, which nice although not always very fast. A bit of rain but quite ok. "Laissons dire et faisons bien", written above the gate of an old village's wall.
20:00 Perroy. Next to the village I find a good camping spot above a vineyard, under a tree with a stone bench next to its trunk. Also it has a view on the lake and the mountains. However I am hesitant. I think perhaps it is too good and too close to the village, such that I might get expelled. I decide to wait a bkt, see if there is any shelter in the village so that I can wait for the announced bad weather to pass and mount the tent later on when everybody sleeps. In the distance, on the other side of the hill, the aforementioned bad weather is there: dark sky, some lightings. I wander into Perroy, very nice but also the kind of premium place with "for wealthy people" kind of accomodation and restaurants. Thus my concern about being reported to the police for camping. Local farmers are putting their horses inside stables in preparation of the storm. The outside of the village is not as wealthy and nice though, I wait there under the shelter of a bus stop. I check the weather. Apparently rain is expected until late at night. This disturbs my first plan of mounting the tent later after the rain, as I want to get enough sleep. I start to worry, even panic a bit and decide to go back to the intended camping place and mount the tent before it starts raining, so at least it is done. It is getting darker and the wind strengthens. The dark clouds are getting nearer. I can see some lightnings firing in the distance ~20h30 Starting to mount the tent. It starts to rain lightly. Lightnings and thunder are approaching. Suddenly I realize the scale of the storm that is about to come. The huge, apocalyptic tier, black cloud is now above the village, almost swallowing it, and coming straight towards me. Rain intensifies. I now really start to panic - aside from getting all my stuff wet, I am afraid that a lightning might hit the tree or the tent I am still mounting. Acting with limited rationality, I abort midway and hastily put my stuff back into my bags. Yet I can't manage to put the whole tent inside my bags like that, the inner part stays out. I leave it curled up under my bags, both of them under the tree against the carved stone. I then jump on my bike and rush towards the village. But tje rear wheel stops. Mistake. I had left the rubber tensioners loose on the rear rack of the bike, and one of them got caught in the wheel. Fortunately the hook of the tensioner took the damage and not the spokes of the wheel. I unlock it and then quickly drive to the village as the rain becomes more and more intense.
I find shelter in front of a barn with a long roof shelter. There is a bench on which I can sit. The thunderstorm is all around. Lots of lightnings. The rain keeps intensifying, it is now a heavy, whipping, dense rain. I have to move inside the barn in order not get wet. There, a hedgehog is eating dry bread on the floor, keeping me some company. I wait for the rain to pass, the thunderstorm eventually calms down. But the weather forecast anounces rain all night, and lots of it. I am hungry and my food is still in my bags at the intended camping place. Also my tent is probably completely wet by now. I'm so stupid, I fucked up.
21:15 I quickly get back to the intended camping place, I pick my bags and bring them with me back to the shelter as fast as possible. Miracle: the inner part of the tent that I had left outside the bags is almost all dry! Then I can finally eat something: some roblechon and terrine with bread, cereal bars, etc. Then I wait, often looking at the weather forecast to see how things are going to evolve. Despite the intensity of that first episode, some additional thunderstorm and rain are apparently expected.
22:30 Round n°2 seems to be coming (?)
23:00-15 Since everything is a bit calmer now, I decide to go back to the camping place and mount the tent. I manage to do it, and very soon afted the storm arrives again. I find shelter in farm again. This time it is the apocalypse storm, even stronger than the previous one, rain like in a typhoon, lightning hitting all around and right above the village. Banging, crunching, rolling thunder noises, sometimes lasting for seconds into the air. At some point a lightning hits the village, current goes off, everything goes dark. I wait, sometimes I eat cereal bars. Had I not find a shelter, I would be scared to death right now.
0:30 It gets calmer, I can go to the tent, luckily it is still dry inside, I did my mounting job well.
Rain continues all night, at first there are still some lightning not too far away, it is scary. Then the thunderstorm ceases, only wind and rain remain, making a lot of noise around the tent. Difficult sleep.

## Day 6:
8:00 I wake up, happy to still be alive. Right from the tent's entrance, I have a beautiful view on the lake and the vineyards. The sky is clear now, I dry up the few of my things that are a bit wet / humid in the sun. Overall things could have been way worse, I'm happy.
9:45 I go following the main road and decide to ignore EV17 since it makes too much detours, and the surroundings are pretty forgettable (in comparison to the Montreux-Lausanne part of the route). Plus the main road has cycle lanes / paths anyway. Front wind, this is annoying.
10:30 Stop in a café on the side of the road, I have breakfast with a hot chocolate, a croissant, and an orange juice. Not the best croissant but ok. I can charge my phone, this is great. 11:30 Go. Still front wind.
12:30 Founex. I buy a sandwich at supermarket Volg, eat lunch (rosbeef sandwich, a tomato).
13h Go. Passing through villages (back to following EV17), vineyards, orchards (...) i.e. the usual stuff on this shore of the Leman. The lake narrows as I approach Geneva. On my left side (direction North) are the foothills of the Jura, quite imposing like a wall yet not too high (in comparison with the Alps).
14:15 Getting close to geneva, following a two by two road, not super nice but at least there are cycle lanes / paths. Road infrastructure is okay but not as well maintained as elsewhere in Switzerland. Is that the French influence?
14:30 Entering Geneva. Passing by many international institutions (WTO, UN), I tour a bit around. Lots of nice buildings in large parts of the city, on the outskirts less nice but at least clean. Many banks, insurances, luxury shops, institutions, it feels like a place meany for important stuff. A bit like the Zurich of Romandie? The huge water fountain "Jet d'Eau". Water infrastructures where the Rhone is born again from the lake. From there EV17 is also labeled as "Via Rhona".
16:30 Spear of the junction between the Rhone and the Arve, alternative place where people perform all sorts of arts and / or sports. Also people bathing in the river.
16:45 Lancy. On the hills behind Geneva, still in the city's urban area. Going through residential districts with mid-sized concrete towers and blocks. Quite dense. Not nice but clean, not too poor either.
17:00 Onex. Previously a village that got swallowed by Geneva's urban area. Nicer residential area, with more nature and more individual housing. Wealthier. Snack break on the village's main place, eating half a chaussée aux moines cheese with bread. I need to find a supermarket to buy water and food for the night. [PB] Today is a holiday specific to the canton of Geneva! I am a bit screwed.
17:30 Go. Soon after I exit the city's urban area, finally into nature again. Vineyards and fields on hills, foothills of the Jura in the North.
18h Passing the dam of Verbois.
18:15 Russin. Really nice vineyard village. I wonder if the water from the village's fountain is drinkable since we are approaching France and standards might change. I ask at the local bar, the local old alcoholics seated in the terrasse answer to me in a kind and funny way, making jokes. The water is drinkable, they confirm. I have solved my water problem, nice! I also wash my face from the sweat and suncream of the day, this feels great. 18:30 Go. I continue in the canton Geneva's far west. Some ups and downs in the hills, nice landscape with the vineyards.
19:30 Chancy, last village before France. Unfortunately no reasonably priced restaurant for my dinner. I first consider continuing and crossing the border to France, such that I can eat some kebab accross the border. But to do so I have to go up quite a bit on a hill, and I am a bit tired, and it is getting fresh as the sun is setting down. Therefore I decide to stay just after Chancy.
20h I find nice field with some promontory where I set up camp. At a few hundred meters is the Swiss border control house on the side of the road that leads to France. On one side of the promontory is a steep grazing land with cows. I start cooking dinner (my food situation is actually not so bad since I have instant noodles, cheese, tomato, peanut butter and cereal bars in stock to eat. Finally something warm to eat while camping thank to that appropriate gas canister!!!  A cow comes near the barrier, interested in what I'm doing. 22h I go to sleep.

## Day 7:
8h Waking up, preliminary breakfast with an apple and peanut butter. While I unmount the tent, the farmer of this land passes by to bring food to the cows, he says hello and doesn't seem bothered at all that I camped in his field last night.
9:15 I go. The path (dirt road) goes into a forest on the hill where the border lies. Quite steep ascent, I push the bike as I am not too motivated by intense physical effort at the moment.
9:45 Official border crossing stone in the forest. Lovely little path.
10:15 Valleiry, first village on the French side. I am now in the French department of Haute-Savoie (74). I stop in a bakery and buy a pain au chocolat, a slice of plum pie and a baguette (5.10eur). I see on the newspapers' cover that the Queen Elisabeth II died. I eat the pain au chocolat, it is delicious.
10:30-11:15 Grocery shoping at a big supermarket (typical of France) (Intermarché) (19.19EUR). The cheese section is great, I get myself a nice piece of abondance cheese.
Storing food in my bags. Removing an ant colony from one of my bags.
11:45-12:00 Chevrier. I stop to eat the piece of plum pie, delicious. Putting on suncream. Nice view on the Jura.
12:30 Entering the Vuache country through a narrow valley with steep cliffs around. At first I am driving on the main road road with cars, then I take an alternative old road to avoid the traffic. Lots of steep ups and downs, I must push the bike quite often. Nice landscape though, inbetween hills and mountains.
13h Village of Aracine, back on the main road. 
13:45 Lunch in a chain restaurant in some commercial area at a road intersection. Sarrasin crêpe and sugar one, coke (20eur). I can charge my phone and use the toilets, that's convenient.  
15:00 Go. Very rural area with hills, fields, forests, small villages. Plus the french Alps displaying their cliffs in the South make for a great scenery. Front wind, annoying. The route is kind of shortcutting part of a meander of the Rhone, riding a few kilometers away from it.
16h Village of Usinens, what a view! Cool downhill on the road.
16h20 Seyssel dam and hydro-powerplant: "Le Rhône au service de la nation" written on the building. The dam has some holes, they are probably "okay" but it does not look very professional.
16:30 Seyssel. Beautiful little town built accross both sides of the river, and with a nice old style bridge linking them. Buying stamps in order to send postcards. Meeting two swiss cyclists who are also doing the Via Rhona. Buying saucisson and chorizo in local small butcher shop (10 EUR), I'm going to have a great dinner tonight. Feels really "vieille france", I love it. Differences with Elsass? Perplexity.
17:45 Go. Still front wind. Short cycle path , then back on main road with cars. Ups and downs.
18:15 Flat route from now on. Going into a forest on a nice cycle path, no more frontwind in there, very cool.
18:30 Cycle path is closed in front of me: in a meander of the rhone the river bank has collapsed and taken the path with it. Ofc there were no signs to warn in advance and / or offer an alternative route. I circumvent the mess on a small dirt track next to the edge, despite the interdiction signs. Aside from this the cycling path is beautiful and smooth, there is even an organized row of tree on the side inbetween the path and the forest.
19:15 Crossing the Rhone over some dam infrastructures, enterring the department of Ain (01). Path goes along a long, human-arranged section of the Rhone (actually a derivation canal of the Rhone), on the side of the dike.
20:00 Lake of the Lit au Roi, I start looking for a place to camp as luminosity of decreasing. I consider a camping in order to take a shower but the one on the side of the lake is too expensive, 15EUR to plant a tent and take a shower???!!!
A bit further I find a spot on a hill atop a human-digged cliff on the side of the deviation canal. I set the tent next to a mossy forest bit and a glade with some beehives. The mossy forest is a bit creepy. Also I have a view on the gorge where the deviation canal flows. I get bitten by a few moskitoes, I instantly react with full clothing protection and repelling spray on the tent entrance. Tonight I feast on saucisson, chorizo, baguette, tomato, abondance cheese, instant noodles, peanut butter and dark chocolate. Aie aie aie, c'est délicieux.
21:30 It starts to rain a bit, I sit in the tent and make tea in front of the opening.
22:15 Sleep. It rains for most of the night.


## Day 8:
8:30 Waking up. I take it slow, eating breakfast (peanut butter and chocolate sandwich), then packing my stuff. I unfortunately can't dry the tent because there is no sun on this side in the morning.
I am greeted by a young father taking a walk with his baby.
10:30 Go. A sign on the veloroute indicates 160km to Lyon. Riding on cycle path along the Rhone, really good infrastructure, really good signs.
10:45 Buying food groceries at carrefour big supermarket (11.54eur), then stopping at a bakery for a baguette and a croissant (1.94eur). Using their bathroom to wash my face, feels good.
11:30 Go. Still super nice, flat paved bike path.
12:30 I find a nice spot in the side river of the Rhone () shower in river cristal clear, 
Then, as I wait next to a picnic table in the sun to dry, comes a couple of retired Dutch, Harke and Nan. We talk for a bit in english about our respective vacations and places of origin.
13:15 Go. There is now some front wind, quite strong. Route still flat nice paved path.
13:45 Crossing Campagneau dam. There I have reached the tip of the South pointing V curve that the Rhone makes in this region.
14:15 Posting my postcards in a lovely little village. The Rhone has a nice blue color.
The front wind is strong, it is super annoying.
14:45-15:30 Lunch break: chorizo slices, an apple and cereal bars. A dog is lurking at me hoping for some chorizo.
15:30 Go. The wind situation is better. Crossing a really nice bridge (pont d'Evieu). Here the Rhone separates the department of Ain (to the East) and Isère (to the West).
Fields and pastures, big beautiful meaty cows. The route then leaves the side of the Rhone to wander more inland to the West through small countryside roads.
16:45 St Victor de Morestel, village whose town hall is beautiful.
17:30 Morestel, very beautiful little town built on a hill and featuring a castle tower amidst lovely stone houses. I stay a bit to visit. Also, since it is Satursday, I make sure to stack up food and water for tonight and tomorrow.
18:45 Kebab (big one) in Morestel, the chef kebabier is very friendly. I am also able to charge my camera battery.
19:30 Go, I still want to ride and cover some distance today before it is completely dark. Kebab = nitro for cyclist.
Small countryside roads passing between fields and forests, downhilling the heck out of it. Beautiful old farms built out of stones. Nice sunset.
Passing next to a few ponds. Abandonned factory next to a village. Dark scary bits of forest with very dense and opaque vegetation walls, almost like a tunnel. The path seems to be an old traintrack that has been re-purposed.
At some point a large pipe running covered by concrete slabs starts running alongside the road. I assume it is some kind of aqueduct. This adds a bit to the ambient scaryness. What if the concrete housing is actually inhabited by some huge crawling insect that goes out at night, hunting for some animals or lonely cyclist? The night has now almost completely fallen, it is dark.
20:45 The aqueduct directly leads to some large domes within a large factory. Rumbling and clinking machinery noise. A metal tower is looming above all of it. The atmosphere is just perfect spookwise.
What if the factory actually releases toxic waste into the environment, causing mutations to animals and plants in the surroundings. Like cows turning into ravenous monsters, and the giant insect of the pipeline.
(The factory is actually a cement plant, but it is fun to let one's imagination run wild to make up spooky stories).
To circumvent the factory, I have to pass through an industrial area. I make sure no one is following me, should they be interested in stealing my bike or my organs.
I keep riding further in the night. The road reaches the Rhone again, then passes through a water leisure area on the Rhone (boats, beaches, etc.).
21:45 I finally find a suitable place to camp on the side of a large corn field. I mount the tent - while doing so I manage to jumpscare myself by suddenly turning the lightbeam of my lamp onto one of my red bags, mistaking it for a doll.
22h I make tea and eat some dessert. The moon is shining bright and sheding silver light onto all surroundings.
23h15 Time to sleep.

## Day 9:
8:00 I wake up. Greeted by a dozen of slugs crawling between the inside and outside layer of the tent.
8:30 The sun rises over the mountain on the other side of the Rhone (East direction). 
I seize the opportunity to dry my things in the sun (tent, mat). I also eat breakfast. Many walkers and cyclists are passing by and greet me.
10:15 Go. Weather is nice, there is a little wind but not in front so it's okay. Heading North before the Rhone turns West.
11:45-12h Snack break in the middle of the fields, sitting in the shadow of a hedge. Sunny weather with no cloud, yet the air is not too warm.
12h Go. Sunflower fields all dried by the hot summer, displaying yellow and black colors. Picturesque villages with old stone houses. 
The traditional architecture of the region consists of yellow stone houses, where the layers of stones make horizontal patterns (through stone size and orientation) in the walls.
12h30 Passing by the nuclear powerplant of the Bugey. Hières-sur-Amby, very pitoresque village on a hill. Going through lots of fields.
13h15 Chavanoz, city centre is very "vieille France" with the local bar and church around a place.
Sun is blazing in the hot afternoon hours, the streets of the villages I pass through are all empty, there are not even cars. Little shade is to be found.
I must say that overall since yesterday the cycling infrastructures and indications are really good.
The route is often close to the Rhone but don't see it much, it is mainly dry fields and small hills.
13:30 Lunch break, I make myself a delicious saucisson abondance tomato sandwich. Primary business in the woods, getting bitten by moskitoes.
14:45 Go. Through the fields. Hot. 15:30 Jons
15:45 Back on the side of the Rhone on a lovely path shadowed by trees. Passing under the TGV (high speed train) and highway bridges.
16:00 Passing the Jonage bridge, riding on the riverbank in the open, no shadow.
16:15-45 Passing through the huge parc of Mirabel-Jonage in the outskirts of Lyon. Really cool place.
16:45 Cycling path going along (but separate from) highways and lots of road infrastructure. Many cyclists, some are driving quite poorly and dangerously. 
17h Passing North of the Villeurbanne district. 17:15 I am now in Lyon. The route follows the South/East riverbank of the Rhone. Lot of cycle traffic. Nice cycling (and more) infrastructure on this side of the Rhone, but not necessarily being well taken care of. Many bridges going accross the Rhone and linking the different parts of the city, some of them really nice in carved stone. Beautiful buildings as well. I wander out of the route to see the city. Place Bellecour, going around the 2nd arrondissement (district) which lies between the Rhone and the Saône. Then going Eastwards, crossing the Rhone again. From wandering the streets a bit (limited perspective), I have mixed feelings abut the city. On the one hand it has an impressive concentration of really beautiful architecture. Also the geography of the city itself, built at the junction of two rivers (Rhone and Saone), is cool. Also it as hills giving it a certain volume which I like. On the other hand, the city gives off a really dirty and messy vibe. Graffitis everywhere (really everywhere), trash lying around, not well maintained buildings and infrastructures. Also, from a cyclist perspective, the pavement is in a catastrophic state all around the city, there isn't two meters without stitches and bumps in the pavement. Feels almost developing world tier in that sense.
The next step for me is to take a train to my friend Pierre-Jean's place. He is living in Villefranche-sur-Saône which is about 30km North of Lyon (outside of EV17 hence the train is allowed). He is hosting me tonight, and tomorrow we will go back to Lyon and continue the journey on EV17 together towards South of France.
19:15-37 TER from Lyon-Part-Dieu station to Villefranche-sur-Saône. Once arrived, PJ comes to pick me up with his car. We load the bike in the car and drive to his house on a hill nearby. Beautiful view on the Alps, we can even see the Mt-Blanc! Nice sunset. I receive a warm welcome from his parents Antoine and Patricia. I take a shower and join them on the terrasse. Apero. Nice dinner prepared by PJ: spaetzle and vegetables, good red wine. The cheese plate has some bleu, I am in heaven. Pear cake in dessert, very good too. Pleasant discussion with everyone.
23h Sleep in a soft bed, so enjoyable.

## Day 10:
8:00 Waking up, eating a nice breakfast with PJ and his parents. Amazing sweet figs from their garden! A good coffee. Pastries. Cheese and bread. Marmelade. I load up on good food for the upcoming journey.
Our plan is to start driving from his home to Lyon, where we will rejoin the EV17 / ViaRhona.
9:45 We go. First we reach a promontory close to his home, where we get a nice view on the Beaujolais (wine producing region), the Alps and the Mt-Blanc. Really cool. Then downhill.
We then ride along the Saône river on a chaotic old towpath. This is quite exhausting and painful for the hands and wrists. Good weather.
At some point the path is blocked due to construction work but no deviation path is indicated, so we go nevertheless. The construction workers are nice, they let us pass while saying they were not responsible for the deviation but some supposedly clever people were in charge of that.
PJ uses a light stiff road bike and carries his material in a large backpack. Such setup, although it might not be optimal for very long trips, is working well for him so I am happy about that, it is good news for the continuation of the adventure. His setup is also faster than mine at equal rider due to lighter weight and improved aerodynamics (at the expense of comfort and adaptability to the terrain). And since PJ is also a better cyclist than I am, he is usually going faster than me. But this is perfectly fine, we just wait for each other at regular intervals.
As we approach Lyon, the riding surface improves, some parts have been adapted with good cycling infrastructures.
Once in Lyon we drive on the road (cycles lanes), the pavement is shit. Lot of traffic, some disrespectful drivers.
We reach the center following a turn in the river, beautiful buildings lining up on the sides.
In order to get a good overview of the city, we start riding up the Fourvière hill, atop which is an imposing basilica. The climb is legit hardcore, I manage to keep up riding but the effort is intense. At some point I stop and push the bike because I don't want to "burn myself" unnecessarily. The road ahead is still long.
13:00 Reaching the top of the Fourvière. Great view on the city, magnificient religious building. We pause to eat the cheese sandwiches that we brought with us. The bleu has melted and is like a better version of butter inside the sandwich. Amazing. I also buy some postcards.
14h We go again, down the hill.
14:15 After crossing the 2nd arrondissement, we are back on EV17, on the eastern riverbank of the Rhone. We head South and soon exit the central part of the city. 
Bridge at the junction of the Saône and the Rhone, we are now on the West side. We first go along a highway, then cross some rather poor and decrepit neighboorhoods. 
Lot of people riding in small fucked up cars, sometimes clearly vandalized.
15:00 We stop to buy groceries at Pierre-Benite in the southern outskirts of Lyon. PJ goes shoping for food while I watch the bikes.
15:15 Go. Driving on the main road with cars, cycle lanes are drawn. Sometimes the cycles lane is physically separated riding on one side of the road only and often alternating sides, which is not very practical because it it forces to cross the road where cars drive at 90km/h. Infrastructure of the road here feels temporary. Signs are good as usual though.
16:00 Vernaison. Crossing bridge to the East side of the Rhone. Now riding a chaotic dirt path that passes next to a lot of dirty industry: a chemical plant from which really strong chemicals smells emanate, a raw material factory releasing a lot of dust, finally a garbage treatment plant whose smell is disgusting.
16:30 Crossing the A7 (highway of the sun), going up a bit on a hill. Now the route becomes a rough mountain bike path with ups and down on a ledge, what a fucking joke. Clearly in this section of EV17, no infrastructures have (yet) been created to accomodate cyclists, the route has just been set to pass wherever is possible / less worse. We meet a couple of swiss cyclist, one of them fell while riding on this part. Once out of this mess, we get back to a chaotic rocky gravel path on the bank of the Rhone. Overall this section of EV17 after Lyon is very disapointing, both because of its poor installations / planning, and because of the lack of interesting things to see. I would definitely not want to live here.
17h00 Loire-sur-Rhone, crossing a bridge over the river, from there the route is much better, smooth paved cycle path next to the river. There is some front wind though.
18h We reach the city of Vienne, it is nice. I go to buy some additional food (it is though to go food shoping while being very hungry). We drink a beer on a terrace, really nice. My hands and wrists are in a bit of pain.
Then we eat a kebab, the place is a bit shady but whatever, it feels good as we are starving. As I want to use their bathroom, there is no toilet paper so I ask for it - one of them hands me an already began, partly re-rolled tp roll which he fetches from some clutter. Shady but funny.
20h We leave Vienne, we would like to ride a bit more today before finding a place to sleep. The route is a smooth cycle path, this is enjoyable after this tough day.
20:15 Hydro-powerplant of Vaugris. Riding amidst vegetable fields and orchards. The night falls.
20:35 Before entering a natural reserve where wild camping would be risky, we decide to call it a day and find a place to camp overnight. A first consideration is next to a really old, abandonned stone house. There we would be hidden from sight. But there are some dark, half-covered by vegetation, gaping holes in the walls. Dunno if some witch leaves in there, we prefer to find another place.
20:45 We finally find a place to camp near a transformer station in the middle of the fields. We are more visible here in the open but it should be okay, we are not disturbing anyone. We mount our respective tents.
21:15 We make tea, and eat some saucisson with cheese. The moon is bright, we barely need our headlamps in order to eat. Atop the hills to the West are the lights of some villages on a ledge, it is as if they were staring at us with contempt.
23h Sleep. Today we rode 100km which, given the overall condition of the route in this section, is a nice achievement.

## Day 11:
6h30 We are awaken by the noise of a tractor's engine. 
7h After laying a bit more in bed, we decide to get out. Everything is very wet from the dew, we are getting attacked by moskitoes. In the field next to us, some seasonal workers are harvesting salad crops.
They do not pay attention to us. We amke ourselves some coffee and eat breakfast, then we pack our tents and material.
8h30 Go. Objective for the day: the city of Valence, about 90km from here. It is nice to ride so early in the morning, there is a lot of mist everywhere from the evaporating dew. Nature and the surroundings are also very nice here: the Rhone flows between hills covered in vineyards. The route is a smooth paved path that follows the riverbank. It should remain as such throughout the whole day according to the map.
8h45 Break at some sort of rest area made specially for cyclist of the ViaRhona. It has lockers, drinkable water, toilets, air pump, etc. Pretty cool.
9h Go. Still the same kind of path as described before, this is great.
9h30 Passing by the nuclear powerplant of St-Alban / St-Maurice-l'Exil.
9h40 Separation of the Rhone in two around an island for the next ~5km. We are now facing a really strong front wind.
The path is boring without much interesting view, but the path is good.
10h Snack break with a view on some industries on the other side.
10h30 Serrière and its blue bridge.


11h15 Village / little town of Andancette. We stop at the "café de la gare", an old bar and café located near the disused train station. We get ourselves some drinks, a nice hot chocolate on my side. Some local alcoholics are already present at this early hour, having a conversation with the barman.
The place feels disturbingly "true" to the social class that frequent it. vieille France with its dated rudimentary almost poor decoration, vernished wood walls, tiled floor, dart game, table football.
It is like an embodiment of this France of the countryside, rather poor and forgotten by all the metropolitan elites.
Not the kind of place where hipsters come to order a fancy latte and whatnot.
Don't take this for serious social commentary though, I am just relating some subjective, short-lived travel impressions.
We can charge our phones and use the toilets, perfect.
12h We go a little bit further in the village in search for a place to eat.
12h15 Picnic at a table in the village's parc. Nice garden, modern style, very recent.
13h Go. Very windy, this is crazy. Front wind. Ugh.
13h30 Bridge to the other side. The wind as an average of about 40km/h with gusts at 60 kmh!!! This is insane. I am suffering a lot from it due to the lack of aerodynamism of my luggage setup on the bike (rear pannier bags). Some gusts are so strong that they almost stop me, I am going so slowly. PJ is going much faster than me but also for him this situation is very annoying. This is so exhausting and demotivating, mentally tough.
14h30 Break in a parc, this wind is madness. 14h45 Go again, we want to make a break in the next town to make a bigger pause and drink a beer there. Fulgurance linguistique: le vignoble ignoble.
15:15 Junction where the Doux river joins the Rhone.
15:30 Tournon-sur-Rhone. We have a beer on a terrace, a nice Fisher amber. PJ checks for hist train as he has to return home because of some obligations. On my side, I should normally continue, but I am faced with a problem. For tomorrow, the weather forecast announces strong thunderstorms combined with super strong from the South i.e. front wind with peaks at 75km/h. This would force me to make a day of pause in Valence as it would be too dangerous to ride in such conditions. But my time is unfortunately limited for this trip, and by waiting a day in Valence I would arrive too late in the South to give a visit to my family there. Therefore I take the decision to end my trip here, take a train from Valence to Vitrolles (near Marseille), and spend the rest of my days with my family in the South. I realize that this type of travel is much more pleasant when one doesn't have tight time constraints to finish. Due to the intrinsicly high variability of this way of travelling (weather, technical problems, physical state, motivation, road conditions, etc.) it is much better to have large flexibility. There is enough bodily physical constraints, no need for extra psychological ones on the mind.
16:30 We take a nice picture of the two of us together using the timer of the camera. Then we go, there are about 20km from here to the center of Valence. 
The f*ing front wind has not calmed down. Ahhhhhhhhhhh. Aside from that the path was very good today.
Slight change in architecture, roofs with big curved orange tiles typical of the South of France.
Exhaustion, I'm dying here. PJ is far in front, he has to catch his train early.
17:45 Hydro-powerplant of Valence. This is so challenging, I am gathering my forces. PJ is waiting for me at the station before his train departs, but I will not be able to make it in time. I must also hurry a bit if I want to catch my own train. 18:00 Entering Valence. I get stuck in a park whose plan indicates an exit bridge that does not yet exist. So annoying. I rush towards the city center and the train station. I buy a train ticket (man those machines are so unpractical to use).
18:42 TER train departs. The bike trip is over. This all went so fast from the realization that I would not be able to finish to now. It is defeat in a way, I am a bit sad about it. On the other hand I am happy that I will be able to see my family in the South of France. And it was still a nice trip and a good endeavour. Also, I will definitely take revenge someday, I will finish this trip from Valene to the Mediterranean sea, mark my words.
21:04 Train arrives at Vitrolles. My aunt Katia picks me up with her car. Good shower, good meal. Happy to see my cousins. (...)
23:30 Sleep

## Days 12, 13, 14:
Good family time. Lot of resting and eating. Some cooking. Little excursion to Marseille. (...)

## Day 15:
Long train journey back home, from 6h to 23h, many changes (I must take local trains since high speed ones have limited spots for bikes that are subject to reservation).
Vitrolles -> Lyon.
Lyon -> Geneva.
Meeting quite a few german speaking people in the train compartments, who are also traveling with bikes. I manage to forget my helmet in the train. Sad.
Geneva -> Zofingen.
Emergency braking of the train. One of the spokes of the front tire of my bike gets slightly bent because I had wrongly put my bike in the holding system. I'm pissed.
Zofingen -> Basel.
Meeting a friend in Basel, good time. Hot chocolate, interesting discussion.
Basel -> Zurich.
Riding from the main station to my home. It is cold and rainy. Vacations are over.

[side-quest] No McDonalds throughout the entire trip ☑️.

bar
